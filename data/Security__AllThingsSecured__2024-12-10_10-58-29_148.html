<h1>All Things Secured - VPN Comparison</h1>
<p>Last month, I spent $671 buying subscriptions to 11 commercial VPNs on the same day using a fake persona. I wanted to know if there was much of a difference between these VPN companies and if they honor their money-back guarantees. I found that there are quite a few differences, and two of them did not give me a refund.</p>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>VPNs do a good job of confusing us with pricing. To make a comparison, I opted for a one-year subscription with every VPN, even if it wasn't the best deal. The pricing was all over the board, ranging from $38.95 for PureVPN to $108.25 for VyprVPN. Based on this sample, you should expect to pay an average of $50 to $60 per year on a quality VPN service.</p>
<h2>Auto-Renewal</h2>
<p>Almost every VPN service I purchased required that I sign up for auto-renewal, which means they will automatically charge my payment method to renew the subscription without asking me first. IVPN was the only VPN that had automatic renewal off by default and gave me the choice to opt into it.</p>
<h2>Installation Test</h2>
<p>The fastest VPN to install was ExpressVPN, which took only 50 seconds. The longest was VyprVPN, which took over three minutes. Most of them had this process streamlined at a little over a minute.</p>
<h2>Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
<p>I waited the full 30 days before requesting a refund for each service. NordVPN provided the fastest and easiest refund process, while many other VPN services made it hard by requiring me to send in a support ticket. I learned that it's essential to be cautious when purchasing a VPN and to understand the refund process before buying.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you're looking for privacy, IVPN is the only one that didn't require an email and allowed for non-identifiable payment methods.</li>
    <li>Use a burner account or an alias when giving your email address to purchase a VPN.</li>
    <li>Spending more than $60 on a VPN is above average.</li>
    <li>Understand the refund process before buying a VPN.</li>
</ul>
