	<h1>Five Cost-Free Ways to Build Privacy</h1>
	<p>
		Privacy is not reserved for those with the means to afford it. It belongs to those who are motivated to create it for themselves. Here are five free ways that you can do that today.
	</p>
	<h2>1. Use End-to-End Encrypted Email</h2>
	<p>
		Most of us have been using the free email options that have been made available to us. Things like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and many others. I recommend ProtonMail, a freemium service that allows you to keep your free email account without upgrading until you absolutely need it.
	</p>
	<h2>2. Use Privacy-First Apps</h2>
	<p>
		The software that we use on a day-to-day basis, whether that's messaging apps, internet browsing, or even social media, it's a bigger threat to our privacy than most of us realize. Using open-source and privacy-first apps can be a beneficial step forward.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm talking about things like Signal for your messaging, which has been end-to-end encrypted and privacy-first from the beginning. And alternative browsers like Brave or Firefox, which are better for your privacy than what Chrome offers.
	</p>
	<h2>3. Use Virtual Credit Cards</h2>
	<p>
		Switching over to virtual credit cards can offer you a lot more privacy benefits. A lot of times it is free to use virtual credit cards, as they get paid for in the fees that happen no matter what credit card you use.
	</p>
	<p>
		I recommend checking out Clutch Cards, a new fintech company that offers granular control over your virtual credit cards. You can create one-time cards, cards with limited spending, and even cards for different family members.
	</p>
	<h2>4. Use a Password Manager</h2>
	<p>
		If you're not using a password manager, I recommend checking out Bitwarden, a free and premium version of a password manager that allows you to self-host.
	</p>
	<h2>5. Set Up a Credit Freeze</h2>
	<p>
		Setting up a credit freeze is really easy and only takes a few minutes. It's just as simple as going into all of the major CRAs and telling them that you want to put a freeze on your credit.
	</p>
	<p>
		A credit freeze can help prevent identity theft by blocking any new credit requests that come in.
