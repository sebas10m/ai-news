<h1>CyberGhost VPN Review: A Solid VPN with Some Missing Features</h1>

<p>CyberGhost is a solid piece of software that offers some great features and benefits, but it also has some missing features and questions about its company ownership.</p>

<h2>Missing Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of features for Apple devices, such as a VPN kill switch, split tunneling, and the OpenVPN protocol.</li>
  <li>Need to register every device that you want to use with the service, unlike most VPNs that have a simultaneous connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Company Ownership</h2>

<p>The company's ownership is a concern, with a history of being sold to an Israeli company known as Crossrider, which was involved in hiding malware in software bundles and infecting user computers with adware.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>In the tests that I performed, the software was effective in hiding my IP address, preventing any leaks, granting me access to geo-blocked services like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and others, and giving me generally fast speeds.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>CyberGhost is a good option for those looking for a cheaper alternative with great smart DNS options and easy-to-use apps, but it's essential to understand the missing features and concerns about its company ownership before signing up.</p>
