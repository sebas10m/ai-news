<h1>Infinite Email Addresses: A Game-Changer for Gmail Control</h1>

<p>You can modify your Gmail address to create unique email addresses without creating multiple accounts. By adding a period or plus sign before the @ symbol, you can create a new email address that still gets delivered to your inbox.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adding a period before the @ symbol, e.g., <code>j.ondo@}</code></li>
    <li>Using the plus sign before the @ symbol with a word, e.g., <code>johndo+werk@}</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These modified email addresses can be used to create filters within Gmail, which can sort and direct emails to specific folders or labels.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Organize newsletters and create filters to skip the inbox</li>
    <li>Use a specific email address to create a to-do list and reminders</li>
    <li>Set up automated tasks and notifications using if-then logic</li>
    <li>Designate VIP email addresses to receive notifications and direct messages</li>
</ul>

<p>By leveraging infinite email addresses, you can take control of your Gmail inbox and customize your email experience.</p>
