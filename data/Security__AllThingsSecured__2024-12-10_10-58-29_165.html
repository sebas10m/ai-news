<h1>Online Security Strategies for a Changing World</h1>
<p>As the world of online security continues to evolve, it's essential to adapt and modify our strategies to protect ourselves from the latest threats. In this article, we'll walk through four key strategies that are no longer enough on their own and provide adjustments to enhance our online security.</p>

<h2>1. Strong Passwords and Masking Additional Data</h2>
<p>Strong passwords are still essential, but simply relying on them may not be enough. To increase security, masking additional data such as email addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses can be effective. Using unique aliases, burners numbers, and virtual addresses can help protect sensitive information.</p>

<h2>2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
<p>While 2FA is a good security measure, it's not foolproof. Adjusting our approach to include physical security keys, rather than SMS text verification or authenticator apps, can provide a more secure option. Sandboxing, maintaining separate email accounts or using specific devices for sensitive activities, can also enhance security.</p>

<h3>3. Managing Public Data</h3>
<p>Personal data can be exposed through various means, including government records, company data breaches, and targeted advertising. To mitigate this, erasing as much data online as possible is essential. Utilizing services like Delete Me to monitor and opt-out of data brokers can be a helpful solution.</p>

<h2>4. Network Security and Education</h2>
<p>Security is not a solitary effort; it's essential to recognize the network effect associated with risk, extending to family, friends, and coworkers. Training our network through predictable communication habits and educating employees on security best practices can help strengthen our security chain.</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
