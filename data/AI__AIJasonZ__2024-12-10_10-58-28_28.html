	<h1>Building an Autonomous Researcher with AI</h1>
	<p>In this article, we will explore how to build an autonomous researcher using AI-powered tools. We will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to create a system that can research and summarize complex topics.</p>
	<h2>Step 1: retrieving relevant articles</h2>
	<p>We will use the SERP API to search for relevant articles on the internet. The SERP API returns a list of search results, which we will then pass to a large language model to choose the best articles.</p>
	<h2>Step 2: summarizing the articles</h2>
	<p>Next, we will use a summarization chain to summarize the content of the articles. This involves breaking down the text into small chunks and summarizing each chunk using a large language model.</p>
	<h2>Step 3: generating a Twitter thread</h2>
	<p>Finally, we will feed the summarized chunks into a large language model and ask it to create a viral Twitter thread. The thread will be generated based on the summary of each chunk and will be presented in a format that is easy to read and understand.</p>
	<h2>Example Use Case</h2>
	<p>Let's say we want to create a Twitter thread about why NVIDIA stock has been soaring. We would input the topic into the system, and it would return a list of relevant articles from the SERP API. We would then pass the articles to the summarization chain, which would break down the text into small chunks and summarize each chunk using a large language model. Finally, we would feed the summarized chunks into a large language model and ask it to create a viral Twitter thread.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Building an autonomous researcher with AI-powered tools can help researchers and content creators save time and increase productivity. By automating the research and summarization process, we can focus on creating high-quality content that is engaging and informative.</p>
