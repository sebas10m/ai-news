	<h1>Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication on Twitter</h1>
	<p>Twitter has removed SMS two-factor authentication as an option for nonTwitter Blue subscribers, but this is an opportunity to increase your security by learning how to use an authenticator app or security keys.</p>
	<h2>Using an Authenticator App</h2>
	<p>You can use an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator, to generate two-factor authentication codes. To set up an authenticator app, follow these steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Download and install an authenticator app on your phone.</li>
		<li>Open the app and click on "Get started."</li>
		<li>Scan the QR code provided by Twitter using the app.</li>
		<li>Enter the 6-digit code generated by the app.</li>
		<li>Save the backup code provided by Twitter.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Using a Security Key</h2>
	<p>You can use a security key, such as a YubiKey, to add an extra layer of security to your two-factor authentication. To set up a security key, follow these steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Plug in the security key and tap it to initialize it.</li>
		<li>Follow the prompts to add the security key to your Twitter account.</li>
		<li>Save the backup code provided by Twitter.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It's recommended to set up multiple methods of authentication, such as an authenticator app and a security key, to add an extra layer of security to your Twitter account.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Setting up two-factor authentication on Twitter is an important step in securing your account. You can use an authenticator app or a security key to generate two-factor authentication codes. Remember to save the backup code provided by Twitter and consider setting up multiple methods of authentication for added security.</p>
