	<h1>Google DeepMind's VO2 Review</h1>
	<p>Google's VO2 has been released, and it's been hailed as a game-changer in the world of AI video. But did it steal the crown from Sora? In this review, we'll dive into the capabilities of VO2 and see how it stacks up against Sora.</p>
	<h2>UI and Features</h2>
	<p>The UI of VO2 is reminiscent of Imogen, Google's AI image generator. It offers options for text to video and text to image to video, which we'll explore in more detail below.</p>
	<h2>Text to Video Output</h2>
	<p>Our first generation was stunning, with lots of details and realistic camera movement. However, we did notice that the airplane in question looked like it had been there for a while.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Four generations were generated for each prompt, allowing for a bit of experimentation and variation.</li>
		<li>We found that prompts with specific character names could result in similar, if not identical, character outputs.</li>
		<li>The physics in VO2 were impressive, with parkour shots and realistic movements.</li>
		<li>We did occasionally encounter some weird movements and teleportation, but overall, the physics were solid.</li>
		<li>Fight scenes and physics were impressive, but still had some issues, such as shapeshifting characters.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Image to Video Output</h2>
	<p>Image to video output was performed using Google's Image N3. We found that the images generated were good, but not perfect.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Re-prompting and re-rolling were necessary to get the desired output.</li>
		<li>We discovered that re-prompting the image prompt in the motion prompt could lead to better results.</li>
		<li>However, letting the model roll on its own could produce some hilarious results.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Comparison to Sora</h2>
	<p>We compared VO2 to Sora, but found that each model handles prompts differently, making direct comparisons challenging.</p>
	<p>However, we did note that VO2's overall performance was impressive, and we're excited to see how it develops in the future.</p>
	<p>Hats off to the Google DeepMind team for their work on VO2. This is definitely a big jump in terms of AI video.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Google's VO2 is an impressive AI video model that offers a lot of potential. While it's still early days, we're excited to see how it develops and compares to other models.</p>
