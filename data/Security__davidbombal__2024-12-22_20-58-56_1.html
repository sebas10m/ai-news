	<h1>Satellite Hacking and Cyber Threat Intelligence</h1>
	<p>In this article, we will explore the world of satellite hacking and cyber threat intelligence. Satellite hacking is a type of cyberattack that involves disrupting or compromising satellite communications. This can be done through various means, including jamming, eavesdropping, or even hijacking satellites.</p>
	<h2>Jamming</h2>
	<p>One of the most common types of satellite hacking is jamming. This involves using a device to disrupt or block satellite signals. This can be done using a simple DIY kit or a commercial-grade jammer, depending on the desired level of power.</p>
	<h3>Types of Jamming</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Orbital Jamming: This involves sending signals directly to the satellite via a rogue uplink.</li>
		<li>Terrestrial Jamming: This involves sending rogue signals at the same frequencies as the satellite signal to the ground station.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Eavesdropping</h2>
	<p>Eavesdropping is another type of satellite hacking that involves intercepting and listening to satellite communications. This can be done using an SDR (Software Defined Radio) and a suitable antenna.</p>
	<h2>Hijacking</h2>
	<p>Hijacking satellites involves taking control of a satellite's systems and using it for malicious purposes. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the satellite's software or hardware.</p>
	<h3>The Viasat Attack</h3>
	<p>In 2022, a cyber attack against Viasat's satellite network left thousands of Europeans without internet access. The attackers used a poorly configured VPN to gain access to the trusted segment of the network and then exploited a four-year-old vulnerability in a Fortinet firewall to gain access to the management console and upload malware to the routers.</p>
	<h2>Cyber Threat Intelligence</h2>
	<p>Cyber threat intelligence is the practice of monitoring and analyzing potential cyber threats to an organization's network. This can involve tracking known vulnerabilities, monitoring for signs of malware, and analyzing network traffic.</p>
	<h2>Defense in Depth</h2>
	<p>Defense in depth is a cybersecurity strategy that involves having multiple layers of protection in place to prevent a single point of failure. This can include using multiple firewalls, VPNs, and other security measures to prevent a cyberattack.</p>
	<h2>Vulnerabilities in VPNs</h2>
	<p>VPNs can be vulnerable to cyberattacks if not properly configured. This can include using weak passwords, not encrypting data, and not regularly updating software and firmware.</p>
	<h2>Cybersecurity Classes</h2>
	<p>If you're interested in learning more about cybersecurity and satellite hacking, OTW offers a range of classes and courses. These include classes on satellite hacking, cyber threat intelligence, and I-O-T hacking.</p>
