<h1>Disruption and Monopoly</h1>

<p>Every company gets fat, dumb, and happy to some degree.</p>

<p>Companies can either do a better job and improve their capabilities or get disrupted by new technologies and ideas.</p>

<p>A monopoly is not necessarily evil, but it can be anticompetitive and stifle innovation.</p>

<p>The question is whether a company is providing a fantastic product and service, or if it is engaging in monopolistic behavior.</p>

<p>Antitrust regulation aims to promote competition and create opportunities for others to come in and disrupt.</p>

<p>Every company gets disrupted eventually, and new technologies constantly emerge.</p>

<p>Crazy ideas can become breakthroughs, but companies may be unwilling to take risks.</p>

<p>Freedom and competition are essential for innovation, but there are limits to the market's ability to provide certain goods and services.</p>

<p>For some problems, collective public goods and social innovation are needed to create a fair society.</p>
