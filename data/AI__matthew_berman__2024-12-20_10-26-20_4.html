    <h1>NVIDIA's Game-Changing Supercomputer: A Tiny, Affordable, and Powerful Device</h1>
    <p>NVIDIA has just released a game-changing supercomputer that is tiny, affordable, and incredibly powerful.</p>
    <p>This supercomputer can deliver large language models to the edge more than any other device, making it possible for open-source models to run independently anywhere.</p>
    <h2>NVIDIA CEO on the Jetson Orin Supercomputer</h2>
    <p>NVIDIA's CEO explains that the Jetson Orin is a micro supercomputer that is blazingly fast at running inference on the edge and can run large language models, essential for robots, Internet of Things devices, and cars.</p>
    <p>The Jetson Orin can run 275 trillion operations per second, making it an incredible computer that can essentially run anything, from robots to Internet of Things devices.</p>
    <h2>Emergence AI Partnership</h2>
    <p>NVIDIA partnered with Emergence AI to demonstrate the capabilities of their multi-agent orchestrator, which can browse the web on behalf of users, making it easier to use and more efficient.</p>
    <p>Emergence AI's orchestrator offers a combination of design time flexibility and runtime determinism, allowing agents to heal themselves and run complex tasks without human intervention.</p>
    <h2>Jetson Orin Performance and Features</h2>
    <p>The Jetson Orin has a 6-core ARM Cortex CPU, 1,024 CUDA cores, 32 Tensor cores, and 8 GB of fast memory, making it a powerful device that can run large language models and vision models.</p>
    <p>The Orin's performance is impressive, with large language models running extremely well, and it can power vision models and vision transformers, essential for autonomous driving and other applications.
