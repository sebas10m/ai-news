<p><b>The Paradoxes of Cybersecurity</b></p>
<p>Cybersecurity is a field that thrives on the existence of vulnerabilities and hacking groups. This may seem counterintuitive, as the primary goal of cybersecurity professionals is to prevent and protect against these threats. However, the reality is that the field of cybersecurity relies on the presence of bad actors to exist.</p>
<p>In order for cybersecurity professionals to have a job, there must be a certain number of hackers and hacking groups. This creates a paradox, as promoting and encouraging bad behavior goes against the principles of cybersecurity. However, if there were no hacking groups, the cybersecurity industry would cease to exist.</p>
<p>As a security professional, one is empowered to protect and defend against threats, including those posed by other users, operating systems with vulnerable code, and applications. In essence, the industry is created by the vulnerabilities it seeks to protect against.</p>
<p>The internet was founded on principles that, at the time, seemed secure but have since become outdated. Vulnerable code is continually pushed out onto production systems, and users are inherently vulnerable and gullible. The presence of these vulnerabilities is necessary for the cybersecurity industry to function.</p>
<p>So, what can be done? Continue to fight for the good guys, and be on the defender's end. This includes penetration testing red teams, which help to strengthen the security of companies, businesses, and non-profits.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the cybersecurity industry is created by the vulnerabilities it seeks to protect against. The next time you're pursuing a career in security, remember that your job exists because of the people who work against you.</p>
<p>This thought experiment challenges the conventional wisdom of the cybersecurity industry and encourages professionals to consider the paradox at the heart of their field.</p>
