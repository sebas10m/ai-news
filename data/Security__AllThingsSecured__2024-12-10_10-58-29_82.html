<h1>Apple's Passwords App: A Review and Recommendation</h1>

<p>Apple has introduced a new passwords app for iOS 18, which looks amazing and functions well. However, I'm not planning to use it myself, but I'll explain why you might want to consider it.</p>

<h2>A brief history of Apple's password storage</h2>

<p>Apple has been storing passwords behind the scenes in the keychain app, which was hidden in the settings. The new passwords app is a dedicated app for password storage, visible after upgrading to iOS 18.</p>

<h2>Feature comparison with third-party password managers</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The passwords app appears to rival other password managers like 1Password, ProtonPass, and Bitwarden.</li>
    <li>It uses Face ID to unlock, with a backup passcode for those without Face ID.</li>
    <li>The app stores all passwords used, including those from Hide My Email and login with Apple.</li>
    <li>It has a dedicated pass key section, codes (2FA authenticator codes), and Wi-Fi information imported from connected Apple devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Simplifying security: Apple's approach</h2>

<p>Apple has done a great job of simplifying security by replacing complex terms with more accessible language (e.g., "codes" instead of "time-based one-time codes").</p>

<h2>Limitations and concerns</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The app doesn't allow storing passport details, credit card info, or encrypted files.</li>
    <li>It's not open source, which some users consider a concern.</li>
    <li>The app is opened using Face ID and a backup passcode, raising security concerns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>If you're already using a good password manager (like 1Password, ProtonPass, or Bitwarden), there's no reason to switch to Apple's Passwords app. However, if you're a dedicated Apple user without a password manager, Apple's app might be a great option to help you store stronger passwords and adopt pass keys and authentication codes.</p>

<p>As for me, I prefer to keep security separate from my operating system and use a third-party password manager. If you're interested in learning more about security and password management, I recommend checking out my tutorials and videos.</p>
