<h1>Build Your Own AI App without Coding Experience</h1>

<p>In this article, we will explore how to create your own AI app without any programming knowledge. We will be using the tool called dust.tt, which provides a user-friendly interface for building and deploying AI apps.</p>

<h2>Introduction to dust.tt</h2>

<p>dust.tt is a powerful tool that allows you to build and deploy AI apps without any coding experience. It provides a Zapier-like interface where you can stitch together different function blocks to build a workflow powered by large language models.</p>

<h2>Building a Code Email GPT App</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Create a new account in GitHub or Google and add your Open AI API key under the provider tab.</li>
    <li>Create your first app and give it a title, such as "Code Email GPT".</li>
    <li>Use the main interface of dust.tt to build a workflow that can help you write personalized code emails to your clients.</li>
    <li>Use the "input" block to create a dataset for client information and the "LLM" block to call a large language model and provide a prompt.</li>
    <li>Insert a prompt to request the AI to write an email to a client based on their name and profile.</li>
    <li>Use the "code" block to extract the email content from the AI's response.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Refining the AI's Response</h2>

<p>To improve the AI's response, you can use a new function called "data" to insert training data and fine-tune the AI model.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Insert a "data" block into your workflow and create a new dataset called "examples".</li>
    <li>Insert examples of training data, including client name, profile, thoughts, and email.</li>
    <li>Use a "for" loop to iterate through the examples and insert them into the prompt to train the AI.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article, we have shown how to build a code email GPT app using dust.tt without any coding experience. We have also demonstrated how to refine the AI's response by inserting training data and fine-tuning the AI model.</p>

<p>With dust.tt, the possibilities are endless, and we encourage you to continue exploring and building interesting things. Whether you have a specific idea in mind or want to learn more about AI apps, we invite you to comment below and subscribe for more content.</p>
