  <h1>Building a Real-World Application with WinServe</h1>
  <p>
    In this article, we will explore how WinServe can be used to build a real-world application. We will focus on building a PDF to Excel converter using WinServe's coding agent, Cascade.
  </p>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this project is to create a Next.js app that allows users to upload multiple PDF files and convert them into Excel files. We will use OpenAI's Structured Output feature to extract information from the PDF files.
  </p>
  <h2>File Upload and Schema Definition</h2>
  <p>
    In this step, we will create a feature that allows users to upload PDF files and define the data points they want to extract. We will use Lama to extract text from the PDF files and then use OpenAI's Structured Output feature to process the data.
  </p>
  <h2>Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    In this step, we will process the data extracted from the PDF files using OpenAI's Structured Output feature. We will then flatten the data into an Excel file and enable users to download the Excel file.
  </p>
  <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
  <p>
    We will include some important implementation notes, such as common errors that the AI model may make, to ensure that the application functions correctly.
  </p>
  <h2>UI Touch-Up</h2>
  <p>
    Finally, we will perform a UI touch-up to make the application's UI more visually appealing. We will use V0.dev themes to control the UI and make it more customizable.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In this article, we have demonstrated how WinServe can be used to build a real-world application. We have shown how to use WinServe's coding agent, Cascade, to create features such as file upload, schema definition, data processing, and UI touch-up.
