<h1>Protect Yourself Online: 6 Common Mistakes to Avoid</h1>

<p>Everyone has room for improvement when it comes to online security, but making changes to how we secure ourselves is crucial to staying safe online. In this article, we'll walk through six common ways that people make themselves vulnerable to hacking, identity theft, and online scams.</p>

<h2>1. Not Balancing Your Bank Account</h2>

<p>Not regularly checking your bank account or credit card transactions can lead to missed charges or unauthorized activity. Make it a habit to review your statements each month to detect any suspicious activity.</p>

<h2>2. Using Weak Passwords</h2>

<p>Using the same password across multiple accounts increases the risk of compromise if one account is hacked. Using a password manager or creating strong, unique passwords for each account can help protect your online identity.</p>

<h2>3. Not Using Two-Factor Authentication</h2>

<p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan. This makes it much more difficult for hackers to access your accounts.</p>

<h2>4. Not Checking Your Credit Report</h2>

<p>Checking your credit report regularly can help detect identity theft or unauthorized accounts. By law, you're entitled to a free credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus.</p>

<h2>5. Being Careless with Public Wi-Fi</h2>

<p>Using public Wi-Fi networks can put your personal data at risk. Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic and protect your data.</p>

<h2>6. Not Being Suspicious Enough</h2>

<p>Being overly trusting of online communications and too hasty to react to suspicious links or emails can lead to security breaches. The STOP method can help you assess potential risks and respond more critically online.</p>

<p>By being aware of these common mistakes and taking steps to correct them, you can significantly improve your online security and protect yourself from hacking, identity theft, and online scams.</p>
