<h1>CRTP Certification Review</h1>
<p>The Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) certification from Altered Security is a well-known and respected credential in the cybersecurity field. In this article, we will review the certification and provide guidance on who should consider obtaining it.</p>

<h2>Who Should Consider the CRTP Certification?</h2>
<p>The CRTP certification is suitable for individuals working on the defensive side of cybersecurity or those looking to transition into red teaming. It is also a great option for beginners in the field of cybersecurity, as it provides a solid foundation in red teaming principles and techniques.</p>

<h3>Technical Level and Exam Experience</h3>
<p>The technical level of the CRTP material is slightly above the OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) certification, but the exam itself is much easier to pass. The CRTP exam is not a trick exam, and the format is straightforward, with a clear attack path. The exam duration is 24 hours, and you have an additional 48 hours to write the report.</p>

<h4>Labs and Pricing</h4>
<p>The lab environments provided by Altered Security are well-designed and simulate a real-world enterprise environment. The pricing for the CRTP certification is very competitive, with a 30-day lab option available for $300. This is a fraction of the cost of other cybersecurity certifications.</p>

<h5>OpSec and PowerShell</h5>
<p>The CRTP certification places a strong emphasis on Operational Security (OpSec) and PowerShell. The course teaches you how to use PowerShell to bypass antivirus and other security measures, which is a valuable skill in the modern cybersecurity landscape.</p>

<h6>Time Requirements and Recommendations</h6>
<p>The recommended time to complete the CRTP certification is 18 hours, but this can vary depending on your experience level. If you have prior knowledge of red teaming and internal pen testing, you may be able to complete the exam in under 5 hours, as I did. However, if you are new to the field, it may take longer. I recommend the 30-day lab option as a minimum, and 60 days if you prefer more time.</p>

<h7>Conclusion</h7>
<p>The CRTP certification is a well-regarded and valuable credential in the cybersecurity field. It provides a solid foundation in red teaming principles and techniques and is suitable for individuals working on the defensive side of cybersecurity or those looking to transition into red teaming. The pricing is competitive, and the lab environments are well-designed and realistic. I highly recommend the CRTP certification for anyone looking to improve their skills and knowledge in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
