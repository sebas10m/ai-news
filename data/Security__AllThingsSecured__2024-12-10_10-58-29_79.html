    <h1>Privacy and Security Q&A</h1>
    <p>Josh from All Things Secured answers nine common privacy and security questions.</p>
    <h2>What privacy software should I use?</h2>
    <p>Josh emphasizes that everyone should use a password manager, set up two-factor authentication, and do a credit freeze. However, the choice of additional software depends on your threat profile.</p>
    <h2>How do I get my spouse to use a password manager?</h2>
    <p>Josh suggests setting up the password manager on their devices and sharing a vault with common logins. He recommends making it easy and convenient for them to use, rather than forcing it.</p>
    <h2>Do you use VPNs on wifi?</h2>
    <p>Josh only uses a VPN when absolutely necessary and recommends avoiding public wifi when possible. He suggests tethering to a phone for a faster and more secure connection.</p>
    <h2>Should I use my mother's maiden name for security?</h2>
    <p>Josh advises against using publicly available information like a mother's maiden name as a security answer, as it can be easily found online. Instead, use a secure answer or a password vault.</p>
    <h2>Why don't you use Apple keychain for passwords?</h2>
    <p>Josh prefers to use a dedicated password manager and browser to maintain control and security. He also mentions a vulnerability in the passcode usage within the Apple ecosystem.</p>
    <h2>What is your biggest privacy concern?</h2>
    <p>Josh mentions being concerned about the impact of his family members' actions on his own privacy and the unknown effects of emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing on future privacy.</p>
