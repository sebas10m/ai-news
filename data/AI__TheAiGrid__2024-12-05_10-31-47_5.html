	<h1>Recent AI Updates</h1>
	<p>OpenAI has been making moves, including poaching three top engineers from DeepMind, a company behind Google's Gemini models. This is a significant boost for OpenAI in terms of talent.</p>
	<p>With these engineers, OpenAI is able to get really smart individuals on their team, housing some of the world's best talent.</p>
	<p>Amazon is also making moves in the AI space, releasing three foundation models named Nova Pro, Nova Light, and Nova Micro. These models are designed to be used for various AI tasks and are a significant step forward for Amazon's AI capabilities.</p>
	<p>Another area to watch is the development of chips, with Amazon releasing their Tranium 2 chips to train these models. This will enable Amazon to build much bigger and more capable AI models from their large compute cluster.</p>
	<p>As AI continues to advance, we can expect to see robots that can perform tasks autonomously. This was shown by the Tesla bot, which was able to perform a catch not once but twice.</p>
	<p>China is also making significant strides in AI, with the government investing heavily in the sector. This has led to several Chinese companies making rapid progress in AI, including Magic Lab, which has showcased a fleet of humanoid robots.</p>
	<p>Google AI Labs has released a new tool that allows users to create podcasts using pre-existing books and PDFs. This is a significant development in the field of podcast creation.</p>
	<p>Additionally, ChatGPT has been found to refuse to say the name David Mayer, with OpenAI citing internal privacy tools as the reason. It's unclear why this name has been flagged, but it's likely due to concerns over the person's privacy.</p>
	<p>OpenAI is also hosting a series of 12 demos over the next 12 days, showcasing their latest developments. This is a significant step forward for the company, and we can expect to see some exciting new technology.</p>
