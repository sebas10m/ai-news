<h1>The Future of Artificial Intelligence: Insights from Ilya Satskova</h1>

<p>The development of artificial superintelligence is no longer a concept of science fiction, but a reality we are witnessing today. Ilya Satskova, one of the co-founders of OpenAI, has shared his thoughts on where we are headed in terms of AI advancements.</p>

<h2>End of Pre-Training Era</h2>

<p>Satskova predicts that the current era of pre-training, which relies heavily on massive text-based pre-training, will come to an end. This fundamental shift raises questions about what new models will replace today's techniques and how the AI field will adapt to the exhaustively used data.</p>

<h2>Agents as the Future of AI</h2>

<p>One of the first points Satskova made about the future of AI is agents. He described agents as genuinely agentic, capable of reasoning and acting autonomously in ways that have only been seen in science fiction. Agents will be able to independently set goals, reason about their environment, and take meaningful actions in the world.</p>

<h2>Synthetic Data as a Potential Solution</h2>

<p>Satskova also talks about synthetic data as a potential solution to the limitations of real-world datasets. He described it as both promising and challenging, and emphasized that figuring out how to create high-quality synthetic data could unlock new capabilities for AI.</p>

<h2>Self-Awareness and Deep Reasoning</h2>

<p>In the long term, Satskova talks about self-awareness and deep reasoning, which will allow AI systems to understand us, have a profound grasp of concepts, and be able to interpret everything like humans do. He also mentions self-awareness, which would give the AI an internal sense of self, its own goals, and its own reasoning process.</p>

<h2>Autocorrect and Hallucinations</h2>

<p>During the interview, Satskova addresses the question of hallucinations in AI models. He believes that future models will be able to reason and understand when a hallucination is occurring, which will be a core feature of future models.</p>

<h2>Out-of-Distribution Generalization</h2>

<p>Satskova also talks about in-distribution generalization, where AI systems can solve problems they haven't seen before. He emphasizes that this is a game-changer, as current autonomous cars struggle to generalize outside of their training data. This will enable AI systems to generalize out of distribution and solve problems they've never encountered.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The insights shared by Ilya Satskova paint a picture of a future where AI is not just an advanced tool, but a new form of intelligence that acts on its own, thinks deeply and coherently, and truly understands complex ideas.</p>
