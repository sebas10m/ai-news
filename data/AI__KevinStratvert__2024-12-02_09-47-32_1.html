<h1>Winning the Google Game: How to Use SEMrush's Content Marketing Toolset</h1>
<h2>Part 1: Examining Competitor Keywords</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll walk you through SEMrush's content marketing toolset, from A to Z. We'll cover how to generate topic ideas, structure your content, and check your articles for SEO results.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Examine Competitor Keywords</h2>
<p>To understand what keywords our competitors rank for, we'll use SEMrush's Organic Research tool.</p>
<p>We know one of our biggest competitors is Top Pot Donuts. We'll type in their URL, <a href="https://www.toppotdonuts.com/">toppotdonuts.com</a>, and click the search button.</p>
<p>On this page, we'll scroll down to the keywords section. We're looking for keywords our competitors rank for.</p>
<h2>Filtering Keywords</h2>
<p>We'll use SEMrush's keyword difficulty filter to exclude keywords with difficulty above 30%. We'll also exclude keywords containing the words "Top Pot" and "Donuts".</p>
<p>This will give us a list of easy and relevant keywords to target.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Identify Seed Keywords</h2>
<p>We'll identify the seed keywords to use in SEMrush's Keyword Strategy Builder.</p>
<p>Some of our seed keywords include: "best donuts near me," "donut holes near me," "apple fritter near me," "cocktail donuts," and "coffee donuts."</p>
<h2>Step 3: Generate Content Strategy</h2>
<p>We'll use the Keyword Strategy Builder to generate an entire content strategy based on our seed keywords.</p>
<p>This tool will suggest related keywords, pages, and sub pages to write to bring in the maximum amount of traffic.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Write Content</h2>
<p>We'll use SEMrush's SEO Writing Assistant to write articles that get us the traffic we want.</p>
<p>For this article, we'll use the "Filled Donuts near me" page as an example.</p>
<h2>Avoiding Writer's Block</h2>
<p>With SEMrush's tools, we can overcome writer's block and blank page syndrome. We'll use the Compose tool to write a call to action, and the Ask AI feature to get best practices for SEO.</p>
<p>By following these steps, we can create high-quality content that will help us win the Google game.</p>
