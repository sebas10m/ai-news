    <h1>CBBH Journey: From Zero to Certified Bug Bounty Hunter</h1>
    <p>I'm going to share my journey of completing Hack the Box's Certified Bug Bounty Hunter (CBBH) path in three months, while working a full-time job and balancing family life.</p>
    <p>The CBBH path is designed for entry-level bug bounty hunters, junior web application penetration testers, and web developers. While it is beneficial to have some background knowledge, it is not necessary to have prior experience in these areas.</p>
    <p>The path consists of 20 modules, each building upon the previous one. The first few modules cover basic concepts, while the later modules require more in-depth knowledge and practice. It's essential to take notes, condense them, and have organized notes to keep track of the material.</p>
    <h2>Module Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Requests and Introduction to Web Applications</li>
        <li>Web Proxies, Information Gathering, and Obfuscation</li>
        <li>JavaScript, Cross-Site Scripting, and SQL Injection Fundamentals</li>
        <li>Command Injections, File Upload Attacks, and Server-Side Attacks</li>
        <li>Login Brute Force, Broken Authentication, and Web Attacks</li>
        <li>Hacking WordPress and Bug Bounty Hunting Process</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal Approach</h2>
    <p>To complete the CBBH path, I developed my own methodology, which includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developing a structured approach to the assessments</li>
        <li>Creating a personal checklist based on the methodology</li>
        <li>Maintaining strong, organized notes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exam Preparation</h2>
    <p>Before taking the exam, I followed the three key steps: mythology, checklist, and organized notes. I took breaks, didn't rabbit hole, and focused on completing the best that I could.</p>
    <p>The exam consists of capturing 80 points of the possible 100, submitting a professionally written report, and having two chances to pass.</p>
