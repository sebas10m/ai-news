<h1>Google Joins Forces with Samsung and Qualcomm to Unleash Android XR</h1>

<p>Android XR is an open platform that combines years of investment in artificial intelligence and virtual reality to bring next-gen experiences to headsets and glasses.</p>

<h2>The Perfect Time for XR</h2>

<p>The underlying technology allows us to process inputs from all different kinds of signals, much like you process the real world.</p>

<p>Android XR is our new platform for headsets and glasses, offering some of the best tools for developers to use, and it reduces a lot of the friction.</p>

<h2>Headsets and Glasses</h2>

<p>We think about headsets as episodic products that you put on for a specific reason, like watching a game, and glasses as all-day products that you use to get value throughout your day.</p>

<p>With glasses, you'll feel like you're a local, no matter where you are, and our technology really enables us to shrink down the displays that go into the glasses.</p>

<h2>Collaboration and Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Building a powerful XR platform requires deep collaboration between software, UX, and hardware partners, as well as an ecosystem of developers, designers, and device makers.</p>

<h2>The Future of XR</h2>

<p>Android XR will enable seamless interactions with AI voice assistants, giving them access to the world, and the world of the AI voice assistants.</p>

<p>Users will be able to perform tasks like watching tutorials with feedback, asking questions about cooking, or even taking phone calls and answering text messages.</p>

<p>The Android ecosystem is massive, with billions of users and an open source operating system, making Android XR an open unified system for XR headsets and glasses.</p>
