    <h1>Building a Universal Web Scraper Agent</h1>
    <p>
        As the amount of data on the internet continues to grow, web scraping has become a crucial process for developers to extract valuable information from websites. However, traditional web scraping methods can be time-consuming and require a lot of effort to handle complex website structures and interactions.
    </p>
    <h2>API-Based Agentic Scraper</h2>
    <p>
        One way to build a universal web scraper agent is by using an API-based approach. This method involves building an agent that has access to different existing scrapers and API services to get information from websites. The agent can receive research tasks and start scraping websites, getting raw data, and utilizing large language models to get structured information back.
    </p>
    <h2>Browser Control-Based Agent Scraper</h2>
    <p>
        Another way to build a universal web scraper agent is by using a browser control-based approach. This method involves building an agent that can simulate complex user behavior, such as navigating through multiple pages, handling captchas, and logging in to access restricted content. The agent can interact with the browser using libraries like Playwright or Puppeteer, making it capable of scraping websites that require complex interactions.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>
        One of the main challenges in building a universal web scraper agent is planning and memory management. To solve this issue, the agent can use a scratch pad to store information and keep track of what data has already been collected. Another challenge is handling complex website structures, which can be solved by using libraries like Agent QL that provide a special model to identify and return specific UI elements.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples and Code</h2>
    <p>
        The article provides examples and code snippets to demonstrate how to build a universal web scraper agent using both API-based and browser control-based approaches. The code includes functions for scraping websites, searching for specific information, and updating data in a database.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Building a universal web scraper agent can be a complex task, but with the right approach and tools, it can be achieved. The API-based and browser control-based approaches can be used together to create an agent that can scrape websites with complex structures and interactions. The libraries and tools mentioned in the article can be used to overcome the challenges and build a powerful web scraper agent.
