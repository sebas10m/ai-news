<h1>Building AI Apps with Landflow</h1>

<p>Landflow is an open-source library that allows you to build AI apps with a drag-and-drop interface and instant preview in a chat experience.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To start using Landflow, you can either use the hosted version on Hugging Face or install it locally on your machine. To install it locally, simply open your terminal and run `pip install landflow`.</p>

<h2>Building an AI Chatbot</h2>

<p>Let's say we want to build an AI chatbot that can feed information from our company's website, PDFs, and different documents into it and provide random information to questions people have. In Landflow, this is quite straightforward.</p>

<p>Firstly, we will use a text loader to extract all the information from a document and convert it into text. Then we will use a text splitter to break down the large chunk of text into small parts. Finally, we will use a vector data storage to store the extracted information.</p>

<h2>Adding Multiple Data Sources</h2>

<p>Now, let's say we want to feed in information from our website, as well as from PDF files. To do this, we can add a loader to upload information to the large language model. We can then use the text splitter to break down the chunk of text and add a vector data storage to store the extracted information.</p>

<h2>Using Flowwise</h2>

<p>Flowwise is another platform that offers a similar drag-and-drop experience to Landflow. They also have GitHub and offer a few interesting predefined agents, such as an auto agent with a predefined template.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many projects that are lowering the barriers for people to build AI apps. Apart from Landflow and Flowwise, there's also Super Agent, Underhook, Relevance AI, and Dust.tt. I'm excited to see what kind of use cases people start creating.</p>
