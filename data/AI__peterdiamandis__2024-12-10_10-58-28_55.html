  <h1>Global Cooperation and the Role of AI</h1>
  <p>Our world is faced with a challenging bipolar dynamic, with China and the US presenting a complex landscape influenced by AI. Ideally, we would have alignment and cooperation among nations. However, it is difficult to provide concrete advice on how to navigate the next five to ten years.</p>
  <p>There are certain elements that are beyond our control, but we can make our own judgments and take steps to reduce the impact of the geopolitical situation.</p>
  <p>One area where global collaboration thrives is open source, where countries work together equally and generously. Academic collaborations also continue to advance knowledge.</p>
  <p>We share a common biology, and breakthroughs in medicine in one place benefit all of humanity. Furthermore, all humans share the same time and face similar planetary challenges.</p>
  <p>Let's focus on shared values and common goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We all share biology, time, and a planet.</li>
    <li>Breakthroughs in one location benefit all humans.</li>
    <li>We face shared planetary challenges.</li>
  </ul>
