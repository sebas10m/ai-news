	<h1>Free Credit Freezes: A Symbolic Loss for Consumer Credit Bureaus</h1>
	<p>Once upon a time, there were three credit bureaus: TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. They were the invisible gatekeepers of credit, grading consumers and assigning scores. However, they were and still are for-profit companies, charging consumers to see their credit scores and selling their data to companies and individuals with a permissible purpose.</p>
	<p>In 2017, a cyber attack on Equifax exposed data for 147 million US citizens, 15.2 million UK citizens, and 19,000 Canadian citizens. This incident led to Equifax admitting to the breach and their stock price dropping, lawsuits being filed, and a huge settlement.</p>
	<p>In response, Congress passed a law in 2018 that prohibits credit bureaus from charging consumers to freeze their credit. This move severely reduced their ability to sell consumer data, which includes sensitive information like credit history, age, and estimated income.</p>
	<p>Although credit freezes limit the credit bureaus' ability to sell consumer data, they offer a solution to prevent identity theft. By putting a credit freeze on an account, the risk of identity theft is significantly reduced, and the credit bureaus are no longer able to sell the associated data.</p>
	<p>The moral of the story is that credit bureaus make money by selling consumer data. While credit freezes are not a foolproof solution for identity theft, they are a good option for those not already monitoring their identity.</p>
	<p>A credit freeze works by stopping new credit pulls and new credit in your name. It's a simple process that can be removed or thawed with a phone call or online request, as required by law, within the hour.</p>
	<p>The benefits of a credit freeze include preventing impulsively signing up for new credit cards and limiting financial institutions' ability to sell consumer data.</p>
