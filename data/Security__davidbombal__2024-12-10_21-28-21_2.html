  <img src="Cisco_AGS_router.png" alt="Cisco AGS Router">
  <p>This is the second generation of the Advanced Gateway Server Router (AGS), a device that was the "OG" of routers.</p>
  <p>The AGS was used extensively in the 1980s and early 1990s, and was known for its reliability and versatility.</p>
  <h2>Connecting to the Internet</h2>
  <p>The AGS was used to connect to the internet using various technologies, including 10Base2 and 10Base5.</p>
  <p>These older technologies are still used today in some parts of the world, particularly in areas with limited access to modern infrastructure.</p>
  <h2>A Starlink Connection</h2>
  <p>The AGS was also used to connect to the internet using a Starlink satellite dish.</p>
  <p>This connection was established using an Ethernet cable, which was plugged into the AGS and then routed to the Starlink router.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This video demonstrates the ability of older networking equipment to still connect to the internet today.</p>
  <p>The Cisco AGS, in particular, has shown to be a reliable and versatile device that can still handle modern networking protocols.</p>
  <p>Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!</p>
