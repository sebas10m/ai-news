	<h1>Updated No BS Guide to Becoming a Cloud Security Professional</h1>
	<p>In this guide, we'll cover the steps to become a cloud security professional, without any prior technical skills or degrees. We'll start with the basics of cloud security and then move on to learn cloud fundamentals and cybersecurity fundamentals.</p>
	<h2>Step 1: Learn Cloud Security Fundamentals</h2>
	<p>Start with learning cloud security fundamentals. This will give you a solid understanding of cloud security concepts, including threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring.</p>
	<h2>Step 2: Learn a Cloud Platform (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud)</h2>
	<p>Learn one of the three major cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. Each platform has its own unique features, so choose one to focus on. I recommend starting with AWS, as it's the most widely used cloud platform.</p>
	<h2>Step 3: Learn AWS Security</h2>
	<p>Once you've mastered a cloud platform, learn AWS security in-depth. Start with the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, which covers cloud fundamentals, security, and compliance. Then, move on to the AWS SysOps Admin exam, which covers deployment, provisioning, and automation, among other topics.</p>
	<h2>Step 4: Learn Microsoft Azure Security</h2>
	<p>After mastering AWS security, move on to Microsoft Azure security. Start with the Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Certificate, which covers IT, networking, and operating systems. Then, move on to the Microsoft Azure SC 900 exam, which covers security compliance for Microsoft Azure Cloud.</p>
	<h2>Step 5: Learn Google Cloud Security (Optional)</h2>
	<p>If you want to learn Google Cloud security, start with the Google Cloud Computing Foundation Certificate, which covers cloud computing fundamentals. Then, move on to the Google Cloud Security Engineer certificate, which covers security engineering for Google Cloud.</p>
	<h2>Step 6: Get Hired as a Cloud Security Professional</h2>
	<p>Once you've completed the steps above, it's time to get hired as a cloud security professional. Make sure to understand how cloud security fits within the cybersecurity ecosystem and that job titles don't always match the tasks. Also, be sure to do some practical projects and continue learning as a cybersecurity professional.</p>
