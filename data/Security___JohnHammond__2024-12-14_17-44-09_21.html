    <h1>Understanding Session Hijacking and Account Takeover</h1>
    <p>In this video, a hacker demonstrates how to steal and take over any account on any website on the internet, using a safe and controlled demo environment. The hacker starts by accessing a Reddit account using a strong and complex password, as well as two-factor authentication.</p>
    <p>The hacker notes that session hijacking is a threat in the cybersecurity landscape that can lead to full account takeovers, data breaches, and financial loss. They explain that session hijacking relies on cookies used to communicate with the website, and that it can be obnoxiously easy to do.</p>
    <h2>Exporting Cookies with the Extension</h2>
    <p>The hacker uses a browser extension to export the cookies from the Reddit account, and then views the exported cookies in a text file. They note that cookies can be represented in different formats, and that the Netscape format is commonly used by InfoStealer malware.</p>
