<h1>12 Essential Tools for Protecting Your Data and Personal Information</h1>

<p>As someone who values online security, I'm excited to share with you the 12 tools I use daily to protect my data, personal information, and overall privacy.</p>

<h2>Password Manager</h2>

<p>A password manager is a must-have tool for anyone using the internet. It helps create unique and secure passwords and removes online login friction by auto-filling strong passwords across devices.</p>

<h3>Alternatives:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1Password</li>
  <li>ProtonPass</li>
  <li>Bitwarden</li>
</ul>

<h2>Two-Factor Authentication</h2>

<p>Two-factor authentication is a crucial security measure. I use a YubiKey security key and have a backup in case of an emergency.</p>

<h2>Browser for Personal Data Usage</h2>

<p>I use the Brave browser to track my personal data usage and avoid the data collection issues associated with the Chrome browser.</p>

<h2>Secure Email Inbox</h2>

<p>I use ProtonMail for secure email, especially for sensitive information and communication with my accountant, lawyer, and other trusted individuals.</p>

<h2>Virtual Address and Phone Number</h2>

<p>I use PostGan Mail for my virtual address and Hushed for my virtual phone number, which helps me avoid giving out my personal cell phone number.</p>

<h2>Credit Card Protection</h2>

<p>I use Privacy.com for my credit cards, which allows me to place time and money limits on merchant-specific cards.</p>

<h2>Data Protection Services</h2>

<p>I use the Legal Removal Request to scan the internet for personal information and remove it, and a credit monitoring service to track my credit and identity.</p>
