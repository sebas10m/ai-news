    <h1>Adding DMARC Protections for Your Domain</h1>
    <p>This article will walk you through the process of adding DMARC protections for your domain, a critical step in securing your email.</p>
    <h2>Manual Process vs. Managed Solution</h2>
    <p>You have two options to add DMARC protections: a manual process or a managed solution. The manual process involves setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records in your DNS settings, while a managed solution like EasyDMARC provides a more streamlined and easier-to-use option.</p>
    <h2>Setting Up SPF and DKIM Records</h2>
    <p>An SPF record lists the IP addresses that are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain, while a DKIM record is used to authenticate emails sent from your domain.</p>
    <p>To set up an SPF record, you need to add a TXT file to your DNS settings with the SPF record data. To set up a DKIM record, you need to create a DKIM key pair and add a TXT file to your DNS settings with the DKIM record data.</p>
    <h2>Setting Up DMARC Records</h3>
    <p>A DMARC record sets the policy for what happens to emails that do not match your SPF and DKIM records.</p>
    <p>To set up a DMARC record, you need to add a TXT file to your DNS settings with the DMARC record data. The DMARC record should specify the policy (none, quarantine, or reject) and the reporting address that will receive DMARC reports.</p>
    <h2>Monitoring DMARC Reports</h2>
    <p>After setting up your DMARC records, you need to monitor the DMARC reports that are sent to your reporting address. These reports provide information about the emails that do not match your SPF and DKIM records.</p>
    <p>You can use a service like EasyDMARC to make it easier to understand and analyze the DMARC reports.</p>
    <h2>EasyDMARC vs. Manual Setup</h2>
    <p>EasyDMARC provides a managed solution that streamlines the process of setting up DMARC records and monitoring DMARC reports. It also provides a more user-friendly interface for understanding and analyzing DMARC reports.</p>
    <p>However, if you prefer to set up DMARC records manually, you can do so by following the steps outlined above.</p>
    <p>Regardless of which method you choose, protecting your business email is a critical step in securing your domain and preventing email-based threats.</p>
