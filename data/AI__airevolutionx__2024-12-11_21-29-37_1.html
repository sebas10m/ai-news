<h1>Sora, the New Text-to-Video AI Tool from OpenAI</h1>

<p>OpenAI has dropped Sora, a new text-to-video AI tool, and it's generating a lot of buzz. However, beneath the shiny announcement videos, there are some concerns and controversies worth exploring.</p>

<h2>What We Officially Know</h2>

<p>Sora was rolled out on December 9, 2024, and is available to subscribers of ChatGPT+ ($20/month) or ChatGPT Pro ($200/month). Users get around 50 videos per month, limited to 720p resolution and 5-second duration, or up to 500 priority videos per month with ChatGPT Pro, with longer durations and higher resolution.</p>

<h2>Availability and Compliance</h2>

<p>Sora is not available in the UK, Switzerland, or the European Economic Area due to complex compliance challenges related to data protection laws and the Digital Services Act in Europe.</p>

<h2>Artists' Backlash</h2>

<p>Some artists who were given early access to Sora alleged that OpenAI used their unpaid labor to improve the tool, without proper compensation or attribution. This led to a mini firestorm, with artists calling for transparency and meaningful reinvestment.</p>

<h2>Quality and Limitations</h2>

<p>While Sora can produce stunning visuals, it has limitations. Physics can be inconsistent, and the model struggles with consistent realism over longer timeframes. Furthermore, there are concerns about the energy footprint of running these video generations at scale.</p>

<h2>Moderation and Safety</h2>

<p>OpenAI's moderation policies are strict, but it's unclear how they are enforced in practice. There are also concerns about the moderation framework being evolving and still imperfect.</p>

<h2>Future Development</h2>

<p>OpenAI plans to upgrade Sora with advanced features, such as multi-scene editing timelines, better training filters, and dedicated theme presets. However, this raises concerns about the potential for users' creations to feed back into the model's pipeline, improving it for everyone else without giving them a say.</p>

<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>

<p>While Sora is an exciting development, there are many unknowns and concerns surrounding its release. OpenAI's Sora may be the cutting edge of AI right now, but we're still figuring out what this cutting edge can do and what it might cut through before we even realize what's happened.</p>
