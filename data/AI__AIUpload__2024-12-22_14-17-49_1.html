	<h1>O3 and O3 Mini: AGI Models</h1>
	<p>Today, we're excited to announce the release of our next frontier model, O3, and its smaller but equally impressive counterpart, O3 Mini. O3 is a powerful model that offers significant improvements over our previous O1 model, while O3 Mini is a cost-efficient version that achieves comparable performance at a lower cost.</p>

	<h2>O3's Capabilities</h2>
	<p>O3 is a strong model that has surpassed human-level performance in various tasks. On software-style benchmarks, O3 achieved a 71.7% success rate, outperforming its predecessor O1 by over 20%. This is a significant milestone in the development of AGI.</p>

	<h2>O3 Mini's Capabilities</h2>
	<p>O3 Mini, on the other hand, is a cost-efficient model that has been trained to achieve comparable performance to O3. In coding benchmarks, O3 Mini achieved a 58.2% success rate, beating O1's performance at a lower cost. O3 Mini also supports three different options for reasoning effort: low, medium, and high.</p>

	<h2>ARC AGI Challenges</h2>
	<p>The ARC AGI challenge is a benchmark that tests the ability of AI models to solve complex problems. O3 has achieved a new state-of-the-art score of 75.7 on the ARC AGI semi-private holdout set, surpassing human-level performance. When asked to think longer, O3 was able to score 85.7% on the same holdout set, a major milestone in the development of AGI.</p>

	<h2>O3 and O3 Mini Availability</h2>
	<p>O3 and O3 Mini are available for public safety testing starting today. We encourage developers and researchers to apply for access to these models and help us test their capabilities.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>We're excited to share the capabilities of O3 and O3 Mini with the world. These models are a significant step forward in the development of AGI, and we're eager to see the impact they'll have on various industries and applications.</p>

	<h2>Future Plans</h2>
	<p>We're planning to post-train O3 Mini with safety interventions and are doing internal safety testing to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of these models.</p>
