	<h1>Ivacy VPN Review</h1>
	<p>Welcome to another VPN review here on All Things Secured. My name is Josh, and as always, my goal here is to give you an honest, unbiased look at the IT companies that claim to secure our online activity as we browse the internet.</p>
	<p>Ivacy VPN is an app that is designed to encrypt your internet data between your device and a VPN server, a connection that is meant to add an extra layer of security to existing encryption measures like HTTPS and others.</p>
	<p>The Ivacy software offers 256 bit encryption for all their connections, thousands of servers all across the globe, unlimited bandwidth, a no logs policy, an internet kill switch, although it's only for Windows and Android, and a 30 day money back guarantee.</p>
	<h2>Unique Features</h2>
	<p>Ivacy allows users to pay for the service using a number of different payment options, including cryptocurrency. They have what they call on demand VPN, which is an interesting feature I haven't seen anywhere else. You can enable the VPN to automatically connect anytime certain websites or domains are accessed.</p>
	<h2>Company Ownership</h2>
	<p>Ivacy's ownership model is opaque, which means we don't know much about who they are or who runs and owns the company. Older VPN reviews point to the fact that Ivacy was once owned, at least in part, by a Pakistani company called Gatatech.</p>
	<h2>Verdict</h2>
	<p>I give them high marks for developing a service that offers numerous privacy-focused payment options, excellent apps, and unique features like Smart Connect and VPN. I wish they would natively integrate OpenVPN or WireGuard protocols, and I'm also not a big fan of companies whose entire corporate structure is hidden behind a wall of secrecy.</p>
	<p>Overall, I rate them a 4.3 stars out of five, which I admit is a very subjective number. But for those who want a user-friendly Smart Connect features at a budget-friendly price, really low price, Ivacy VPN offers an excellent value there.</p>
