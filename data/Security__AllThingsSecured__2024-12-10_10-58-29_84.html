<h1>How to Protect Your YouTube Channel from Hacks</h1>

<p>I recently experienced a hack on my YouTube channel, and it was a sobering reminder of the importance of online security. In this article, I'll share five changes you can make to protect your YouTube channel from hacks.</p>

<h2>The Anatomy of a Hack</h2>

<p>The anatomy of a hack is simple but shockingly effective. There are two primary methods used to scam YouTubers: impersonation and backdoor attacks. Impersonation attacks involve scammers sending emails or messages that appear to be from Google or YouTube, tricking creators into clicking on links or downloading malware. Backdoor attacks involve hackers gaining access to a creator's account through another member of their team or a device associated with their channel.</p>

<h2>Protecting Your Channel</h2>

<p>Here are five changes you can make to protect your YouTube channel from hacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use physical security keys as your two-factor authentication (2FA) and force your team to use them as well.</li>
  <li>Limit admin access to your channel and compartmentalize data access to prevent hackers from deleting videos or entire channels.</li>
  <li>Use a non-Windows operating system, such as Apple or Linux, which seems to be less vulnerable to hacking.</li>
  <li>Build alternative platforms for distribution and marketing to reduce reliance on YouTube.</li>
  <li>Never give over your password and be extremely skeptical of any email that purports to come from Google or YouTube.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The YouTube platform is an amazing tool for creators, but it also needs to be more secure. I encourage you to tweet this article to YouTube so they can see it and possibly enact positive change.</p>

<h3>Important Suggestions for YouTube</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stop allowing people to send messages from trusted domains.</li>
  <li>Require 2FA reauthorization whenever any kind of anomaly occurs.</li>
  <li>Prevent users from accessing their accounts from somewhere else in the world without 2FA.</li>
</ul>
