	<h1>Live Agent Studio</h1>
	<p>The Live Agent Studio is a community-driven platform filled with cutting-edge agents for you to go and try out yourself right now and learn how to implement them for yourself and your business.</p>
	<p>All of the agents are completely open source, and I've created a way for you and the community to contribute agents to the platform, so together we can build the best collection of AI agents.</p>
	<h2>Agents</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Pydantic AI Web Researcher</li>
		<li>Zubair's Business Idea Researcher</li>
		<li>Nate's LinkedIn X and Blog Content Creator</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>The Live Agent Studio is a platform where you can try out agents, learn how to implement them, and even contribute your own agents to the community.</p>
	<p>Each agent has its own unique features and capabilities, and they are all open source, allowing you to view the code and customize them to fit your needs.</p>
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>To get started with the Live Agent Studio, simply head over to studio.automator.ai and play with the agents yourself.</p>
