<h1>Comparing Encrypted Email Providers</h1>

<p>Last month, I spent $238 buying subscriptions to five of the most popular encrypted email providers on the market: Proton, Tudor (formerly Tutanota), Mailfence, Startmail, and Hushmail.</p>

<h2>Data Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Proton is based in Switzerland, a country known for its strict data protection laws and strong privacy standards. Tudor, Mailfence, and Startmail are based in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, respectively, all of which are part of the EU and subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Hushmail is based in Canada, which has good privacy laws but may not be as ideal as the EU.</p>

<h2>Encryption</h2>

<p>All of these services offer PGP support, but the software architecture is also important. Zero-knowledge architecture, used by Proton, Tudor, Mailfence, and Hushmail, puts all encryption keys and processes in the user's possession, ensuring that the company cannot access their email. However, this approach also means that users are solely responsible for their account security.</p>

<h2>Two-Factor Authentication</h2>

<p>While all providers offer some form of 2FA, only Proton and Tudor support YubiKeys. This is a crucial aspect of secure email, as it provides an additional layer of protection against account compromise.</p>

<h2>Calendar and Cloud Drive</h2>

<p>Proton and Mailfence offer encrypted calendar and cloud drive services that integrate seamlessly with their email product. Tudor has a encrypted calendar, but its cloud drive is still in development. Startmail and Hushmail do not offer these features.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<p>Proton, Tudor, and Hushmail have native mobile apps, while Proton, StartMail, and Hushmail allow for unlimited aliases. Tudor and Mailfence limit aliases based on the user's plan. All providers offer custom domains, but StartMail requires an additional fee.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>The average price among these services is $48, making Tudor the best value and StartMail the highest investment.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>Based on the comparison, I recommend ProtonMail for its unlimited aliases and suite of privacy services. Tudor is a close second, offering the strongest email at the best value. Both providers support YubiKeys, which is essential for secure email.</p>

<p>I suggest purchasing two YubiKeys for added protection, and considering ProtonMail or Tudor if you value secure email and calendar/cloud drive services.</p>
