    <h1>Building an AI Girlfriend with Large Language Model and Text-to-Speech Model</h1>
    <p>In this article, we will explore how to build an AI girlfriend using a large language model and a text-to-speech model. This project is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, requiring less than 100 lines of code.</p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A large language model like GPT</li>
        <li>A text-to-speech model like 11Labs</li>
        <li>Pip and LanChain installed on your computer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 1: Setting up the Project</h2>
    <p>Create a folder called AI girlfriend and create a.env file to store credentials and API key.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Creating a Prompt Template</h2>
    <p>Define a prompt template to get a response from GPT, including variables for human input and conversation history.</p>
    <h2>Step 3: Creating a Function to Get Response from GPT</h2>
    <p>Create a function to get a response from GPT using the prompt template and variables.</p>
    <h2>Step 4: Creating a Web UI</h2>
    <p>Create a basic web UI using Flask to get user input and pass it to the function to get a response from GPT.</p>
    <h2>Step 5: Integrating Text-to-Speech Model</h2>
    <p<Integrate the 11Labs text-to-speech model to convert the GPT response to audio.</p>
    <h2>Step 6: Testing the AI Girlfriend</h2>
    <p>Test the AI girlfriend by sending messages and listening to responses.</p>
