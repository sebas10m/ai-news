<h1>Exploring Virtual Addresses: Security, Features, and Options</h1>

<p>Using virtual addresses allows us to accept mail while hiding our actual location, like a sophisticated P.O. box. Mail sent to a virtual address is either sorted on-site or forwarded to a sorting facility, scans are sent via email or phone, and the surrounding process varies. Some companies, like PostScan Mail, allow physical pickup of mail and are secure locations for small businesses.</p>

<p>In the author's experiment, they sent three packages to three different virtual mailbox addresses to explore how they work. The author used Apple AirTags to track each package and visit each location. During the investigation, the author encountered both excellent services and some less-than-ideal experiences. Many virtual addresses are forwarding hubs, where mail is sent to the company's main hub, rather than being sorted or scanned on-site. This can result in slower processing times and increased risks of mail mishandling.</p>

<p>The author highlights three important lessons learned from their experience:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Virtual addresses are not all created equal; some are forwarding hubs, while others are primary hubs that provide additional security features.</li>
    <li>Renting a post-scan mail address can give you more control over your mail, allowing you to scan, shred, forward, or pick up the mail in person, making it a suitable option for individuals and small businesses looking for more flexibility.</li>
    <li>When choosing a virtual address service, it's essential to consider the level of security required, the option to pick up mail in person, the potential for time-sensitive mail, and the address's visibility on Google Maps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, the author emphasizes the importance of asking questions before subscribing to a virtual address service, such as the level of security, the option for physical pickup, and the potential for time-sensitive mail. By doing so, individuals and businesses can ensure they're using a secure and convenient virtual address service that meets their needs.</p>
