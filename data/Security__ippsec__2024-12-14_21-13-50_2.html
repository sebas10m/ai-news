    <h1>Authentication Bypass on Compiled (Hack The Box)</h1>
    <h2>Written by Ipsek</h2>
    <p>
        The hardest part of this machine is probably the privilege escalation. Most Windows privilege escalation involves misconfigurations or running processes. However, this machine is vulnerable just because a piece of software is installed, which is not running at the time of exploitation.
    </p>
    <h2>Exploit Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The exploit involves abusing a vulnerable Git version to write files in the.git directory, which can lead to code execution. This is achieved by exploiting the Git clone command, which is used to download submodules. The submodule is crafted to create a symlink to the.git directory, allowing the Git hooks to be executed.
    </p>
    <h2>Exploit Details</h2>
    <p>
        The bug was identified as a symlink vulnerability in Git, which allows an attacker to create a symlink to the.git directory and execute arbitrary code. The exploit involves creating a submodule with a file that contains a malicious Git hook. When the Git clone command is executed, the hook is triggered, and the malicious code is executed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exploit also uses a technique called "directory junction" to create a link between the.git directory and a directory on the filesystem. This allows the attacker to write files to the.git directory and execute code in the context of the Git process.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exploit was validated by exploiting a vulnerable Git server and executing a reverse shell. The reverse shell was used to gain a foothold on the system and execute further exploits to gain elevated privileges.
    </p>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <pre>
```get t database</pre>
    <p>
        The code uses the SQLite library to interact with the Git database. It reads the database file, parses the contents, and outputs the hashes in a format suitable for cracking.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code also includes a feature to output the usernames in the hashcat format if the -u option is provided. This allows the user to generate a hashcat file with the usernames included in the output.
    </p>
    <h2>Python Script</h2>
    <pre>
```python
import sqlite3
import sys

# Connect to the database
connection = sqlite3.connect(sys.argv[1])

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Query the database
cursor.execute("SELECT name, algo, iterations, key_length FROM user")

# Fetch all the rows
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Loop through the rows and output the hashes
for row in rows:
    # Get the username, salt, password, and hash from the row
    username = row[0]
    salt = row[1]
    password = row[2]
    hash = row[3]

    # Output the hash in base64 format
    print(f"{username}:{salt}:{password}:{hash}")
```
</pre>
    <p>
        The script uses the sqlite3 library to connect to the database and execute a SQL query to retrieve the username, salt, password, and hash from the user table.
    </p>
    <p>
        The script then loops through the rows and outputs the hashes in base64 format.
    </p>
    <p>
        The script also includes an option to output the usernames in the hashcat format if the -u option is provided.
    </p>
