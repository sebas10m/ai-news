  <h1>Amazon Data Collection and Use of Personal Information</h1>
  <p>Amazon tracks a wide range of data points about its customers, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every order placed on the website</li>
    <li>Every show watched on Amazon Prime Video</li>
    <li>Every song listened to on Prime Music</li>
    <li>Every request made on Alexa</li>
    <li>Every record of motion on Ring doorbells</li>
    <li>Kindle reading data, including date, time, and highlighted passages</li>
    <li>Audible account data</li>
    <li>Fire TV usage data</li>
    <li>Physical address</li>
    <li>Credit history</li>
    <li>Search history</li>
    <li>Website clicks</li>
    <li>Internet usage via advertisements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Amazon collects this data through three main channels:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The data we voluntarily provide to Amazon, such as credit card information and address</li>
    <li>Metadata collected by Amazon, including device type, IP address, and browsing history</li>
    <li>Data received from third parties, including credit bureaus and subsidiaries</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Stopping Amazon's Data Collection</h2>
  <p>While Amazon's data collection practices have raised concerns, there are limited options for consumers to stop or limit Amazon's tracking:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete your Amazon account, which is the most extreme option</li>
    <li>Use a web browser that blocks third-party cookies while shopping on Amazon</li>
    <li>Use a different browser for shopping and browsing</li>
    <li>Pay for Amazon purchases using a virtual credit card</li>
    <li>Use a virtual address for package delivery</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>While Amazon's data collection practices are extensive, there are steps consumers can take to limit Amazon's data collection. However, these options are limited and require significant changes to daily behavior.</p>
