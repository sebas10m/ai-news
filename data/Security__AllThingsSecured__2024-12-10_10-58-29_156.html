<h1>IPVanish Review</h1>
<p>IPVanish is a virtual private network that has been around since 2012. In this comprehensive review, we'll take a look at the desktop and mobile apps, features, and ownership model.</p>
<h2>Desktop and Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>The IPVanish desktop app has a simple layout with a connect button on the top right and a list of servers on the bottom right. The mobile app is similar, with a connect button on the bottom right and a list of servers on the upper left-hand corner.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>256-bit encryption</li>
  <li>1400 servers spread across 50 countries</li>
  <li>VPN kill switch</li>
  <li>Zero log policy</li>
  <li>Standalone apps for all major platforms</li>
  <li>10 simultaneous connections</li>
  <li>250 gigabytes of free cloud storage through SugarSync</li>
  <li>Great customer support, including email, live chat, and phone support</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ownership Model</h2>
<p>IPVanish is owned by NetProtect, which is a company that owns several other VPN properties. In 2019, NetProtect was acquired by J2 Global, a publicly traded technology company based in the US.</p>
<p>This ownership model can be seen as both good and bad. On the one hand, having a publicly traded company as the owner can provide additional transparency and accountability. On the other hand, some may be concerned about the potential for data sharing and security risks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>IPVanish has all the standard features expected from a VPN, plus some unique features like 10 simultaneous connections and 250 gigabytes of free cloud storage. While the software itself could use a refresh, the company's customer support and ownership model are major positives.</p>
