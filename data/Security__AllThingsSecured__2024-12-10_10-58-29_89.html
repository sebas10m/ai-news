<h1>Securing Your WordPress Website</h1>

<p>With almost half a billion websites running on WordPress, the platform's flexibility and ease of use come with a price – increased security risks.</p>

<h2>Lock Down the Login Page</h2>

<p>Start by making the most hackable part of your website more secure – the login page. Remove 'admin' as a login option, create a stronger login password, limit login attempts, and move the login page to a custom URL.</p>

<h3>Remove Admin as a Login Option</h3>

<p>Get rid of the default user 'admin' by creating a new user with a different name and email address and assigning it administrator privileges.</p>

<h3>Create a Stronger Login Password</h3>

<p>Use a tool to test and generate a strong password for any administrative user.</p>

<h3>Limit Login Attempts</h3>

<p>Use the WPS Limit Login plugin to limit the number of times a user can try to log in with an incorrect password.</p>

<h3>Move the Login Page to a Custom URL</h3>

<p>Use the WPS Hide Login plugin to change the login URL and make it harder for hackers to find.</p>

<h2>Secure Your Backend</h2>

<p>Modify your WordPress backend to make your site more secure by deleting unused plugins and themes, checking plugins for updates, and removing unused user profiles.</p>

<h3>Delete Unused Plugins and Themes</h3>

<p>Remove any inactive plugins and themes that can still have security bugs and hurt your site's performance.</p>

<h3>Check Plugins for Updates</h3>

<p>Go through your current plugins and check when they were last updated, and replace any plugins that are outdated.</p>

<h3>Remove Unused User Profiles</h3>

<p>Delete any unused user profiles to prevent security risks.</p>

<h2>Keep Your Site Up to Date</h2>

<p>Keep your plugins and core WordPress install updated to the latest version, and consider upgrading to managed WordPress hosting for daily backups, firewall protection, and more.</p>

<p>Instead of investing in security plugins, consider investing in better hosting to secure your website.</p>

<p>Remember to keep your plugins and core WordPress install updated to the latest version to fix security bugs and prevent hackers from exploiting them.</p>
