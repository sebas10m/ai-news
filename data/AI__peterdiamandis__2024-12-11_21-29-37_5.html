<h1>Background and Challenges Faced by Zero1.ai</h1>

<p>When founding Zero1.ai, the team realized they were behind OpenAI by seven years, having only been established 17 months prior. Initially, the founder lacked a team of engineers and spent the first four to five months hiring people.</p>

<p>The team decided not to compete directly with OpenAI but instead focused on building quickly and efficiently. By leveraging the strengths of Chinese entrepreneurs and engineers, they aimed to develop products that were competitive and cost-effective.</p>

<p>The goal was not to match OpenAI's accuracy but to create an equally accurate product at a lower cost. This would make it more feasible to adopt, especially considering the challenges related to access to compute and inference. The team had limited resources, which motivated them to be more innovative and efficient in their approach.</p>

<p>Scarcity of resources, particularly GPUs, forced the team to think differently and prioritize their goals. Despite having fewer than 2% of the compute resources available to US companies, they concentrated on efficiency, power of engineering, and vertical integration.</p>

<p>The team's approach was to match the performance of existing AI models, like GPT-4, using a smaller number of GPUs. By doing so, they could create efficient models that required minimal compute resources, making them suitable for various applications. This approach enabled them to build a more innovative and cost-effective product without relying on excessive resources.</p>

<p>By overcoming these challenges and focusing on efficiency, power engineering, and vertical integration, the team at Zero1.ai has made significant progress in developing competitive AI products despite the limitations of their resources.</p>
