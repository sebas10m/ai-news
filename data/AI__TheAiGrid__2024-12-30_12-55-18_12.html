    <h1>OpenAI's AGI Definition and Its Implications</h1>
    <p>Recently, OpenAI defined what AGI is, a concrete definition of what AGI is going to do and what it means for major companies moving forward.</p>
    <p>With Microsoft investing $10 billion in OpenAI, they have a secret AGI definition. The deal was important because there was a specific part of the deal that Microsoft would only get access to pre-AGI technology.</p>
    <p>OpenAI is trying to make their company public and changing the deal so that Microsoft gets access to equity instead of shares that entitle them to future profits.</p>
    <p>The world is moving towards building a new infrastructure of energy, land use, chips, data centers, data, AI models, and AI systems for the 21st century economy.</p>
    <p>OpenAI is trying to go public, but it's a big challenge when individuals like Elon Musk are currently suing them.</p>
    <p>Microsoft losing its grip and OpenAI needing more compute, but Microsoft is like "no, we're going to be the only people that provide you this compute".</p>
    <p>AGI definition means an automated system that can outperform most people at most economically valuable work. OpenAI recently updated the definition, saying an AI system can generate at least $100 billion in profits.</p>
    <p>This definition is changing because of the rapid progress in AI.</p>
    <p>The AGI definition thoroughly changing from most economically valuable work to a point where AI systems can generate at least $100 billion in profits.</p>
    <p>This is going to be a remarkable year in 2029 when AGI is open and free.</p>
    <p>The companies will have humanoid robots, voice agents, and a web browser.</p>
    <p>The AGI definition is changing, and it will be interesting to see how these companies manage to change now that they have a lot of money and are able to manage the economy.</p>
