<h1>Update on DeleteMe Service</h1>
<p>The DeleteMe service claims to scour the internet for personal information and make removal requests on behalf of users. After using the service for a year, I want to provide an update on my experience and answer common questions about the service.</p>

<h2>DeleteMe Dashboard</h2>
<p>The DeleteMe dashboard provides a detailed report of the user's publicly available data, including listings reviewed, data found, and data removed. The dashboard also allows users to update their information, make custom requests for data removal, and view their history and privacy report.</p>

<h2>Removing Data</h2>
<p>The service allows users to remove their data from various data brokers, including those that may not be easily found online. The average time saved from using the service is almost a day, with potential savings of $10 an hour. The service also provides a breakdown of which data brokers have the user's data and which ones have been removed or are currently being requested.</p>

<h2>Common Questions</h2>
<h3>1. Are we trusting this company with too much data?</h3>
<p>No, I am not giving DeleteMe my sensitive data such as my identity number, social security number, or credit card number. I am only giving them publicly available data that can be found online for free.</p>

<h3>2. Can I do this myself?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is possible to remove data from data brokers on your own, but it would take a significant amount of time and effort. DeleteMe provides a full breakdown of how to make removal requests on their website.</p>

<h3>3. Does this cost money?</h3>
<p>Yes, DeleteMe is a paid service. The cost is justifiable for users who value their time and want to maintain a high level of privacy online.</p>

<h3>4. Why keep a subscription?</h3>
<p>I recommend keeping a subscription to DeleteMe because data continues to reappear and data brokers continue to scrape more information. It is worth the cost to maintain a high level of privacy and reduce spam calls and junk mail.</p>

<h3>5. Am I receiving less spam calls and junk mail?</h3>
<p>I have noticed a decrease in spam calls, but it is unclear whether this is due to DeleteMe or my own actions, such as putting myself on the Do Not Call list. Junk mail is unlikely to decrease using DeleteMe, as it is often a mass mailing addressed to the current resident, not the individual.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My experience with DeleteMe has been positive, and I highly recommend the service to users who value their time and want to maintain a high level of privacy online.</p>
