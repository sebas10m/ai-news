    <h1>O3 and O3 Mini: Next-Generation Frontier Models</h1>
    <h2>New Territory in AGI</h2>
    <p>OpenAI has released O3, a new frontier model that surpasses all previous models in performance and capabilities.</p>
    <h2>AGI Achieved?</h2>
    <p>O3 has achieved an ELO score of 2727 on the competition code benchmark, beating the previous best score of 1891.</p>
    <h2>AMAZING Results</h2>
    <p>O3 has achieved a flawless score of 96.7% on the competition math benchmark and 87.7% on the PhD-level science questions benchmark (GPQA diamond).</p>
    <h2>Next Frontier in AGI</h2>
    <p>The Arc AGI benchmark is the latest challenge in AGI, requiring models to learn and apply knowledge in new and unseen contexts.</p>
    <h2>O3 Mini: Cost-Efficient Reasoning Frontier</h2>
    <p>O3 mini is a new model that achieves comparable performance to O1 mini at a fraction of the cost, making it a cost-efficient reasoning frontier.</p>
    <h2>Crushing the Competition</h2>
    <p>O3 mini has achieved a 10x improvement on the Epic AI's Frontier Math Benchmark, beating all previous models.</p>
    <h2>Impact on Development</h2>
    <p>O3 and O3 mini will revolutionize AI development, enabling faster and more efficient creation of AI models for various applications.</p>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>OpenAI is opening up O3 mini and O3 to external safety testing, inviting researchers to apply for early access and contribute to the development of these models.</p>
