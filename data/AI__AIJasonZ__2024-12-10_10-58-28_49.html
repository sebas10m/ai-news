	<h1>Exploring Multimodal AI with Lava</h1>
	<h2>A Brief Overview</h2>
	<p>Recently, large language models like OpenAI GPT-4 and Google Palm 2 have shown incredible results in integrating visual inputs and text to perform multimodal tasks. This next frontier of generative AI enables models to take in various data types, such as images, videos, and audio, and use them to solve problems and reason across different types of data.</p>
	<h2>How Lava Works</h2>
	<p>Lava, a multimodal released recently, represents a large language and vision assistant. It can run multimodal tasks across both image and text and is integrated with the Lama tool. I had the chance to try it out and was very impressed with its performance.</p>
	<h2>Use Cases</h2>
	<p>One potential use case for Lava is product development. By providing a sketch or mockup, the model can generate a product requirement doc, breaking down the interface navigation, and identifying key features. Another use case is content curation, where Lava can classify and rate content based on its violence score.</p>
	<h2>Demo and Hands-On Experience</h2>
	<p>For those interested, you can try out Lava on its GitHub page and install it on your local machine. The demo website also has a public page where you can use Lava right away. Some examples of how to use Lava include uploading an image and asking it to describe the scene, or to generate a story based on the image.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The potential applications of Lava are vast, ranging from medical diagnosis to product development. Its ability to understand and reason across multiple data types makes it a powerful tool for various industries and tasks. As research and development continue, it will be interesting to see the extent to which Lava and similar models can be used in real-world scenarios.</p>
