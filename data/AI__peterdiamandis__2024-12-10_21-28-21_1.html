	<h1>The Third Way: A New Approach to Work and the Future of Organizations</h1>
	<p>In this episode of Moonshots, Peter Diamandis explores the concept of the third way, a new approach to work and the future of organizations. He is joined by Jack Hittery, CEO of Sandbox AQ, and Nadia Heron, General Manager of AI Simulation at Sandbox AQ.</p>
	<p>The discussion centers around the false dichotomy between returning to the office and working from home, and how a third way can empower people to work more effectively and achieve better outcomes. Jack and Nadia share their experiences with the three Cs approach: collaboration, customer, and community.</p>
	<p>The conversation also touches on the importance of outcome-based leadership, treating people like adults, and providing a supportive environment for employees to thrive. Jack and Nadia discuss their own company's approach to work, which includes unlimited vacation policy, outcome-based objectives, and a focus on making a positive impact.</p>
	<p>They also explore the future of work, including the impact of AI and humanoid robots on the job market. Jack predicts that AI will create millions of new jobs, but also lead to a divergence in the job market, where some companies will thrive while others will struggle. Nadia adds that human-AI collaboration will become more prevalent, leading to new products and solutions.</p>
	<p>The discussion concludes with Peter's thoughts on the exponential organization, highlighting the importance of agility, collaboration, and the focus on making a positive impact. He also notes that the old-school educational model needs to change, and that the future of work will be shaped by new technologies and tools that enable collaboration and flexibility.</p>
	<p>Throughout the conversation, Jack and Nadia share their insights and experiences, offering a unique perspective on the future of work and the importance of creating a supportive environment for employees to thrive.</p>
	<p>The episode ends with a call to action, encouraging listeners to explore the three Cs approach and consider how they can apply it to their own work and organizations.</p>
