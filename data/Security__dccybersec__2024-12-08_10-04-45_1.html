<h1>Exploring the Gold Coast with a Drone</h1>

<p>Today was a pleasant day off with a chance to fly my drone around to the beach.</p>

<p>I drove through Talabudra and almost reached Burley Heads before switching to the Burley Cliffs to capture some footage.</p>

<p>However, my drone was unexpectedly unable to operate in the vicinity of a large airport near Currumbin due to warning and alert systems indicating that flying was prohibited in the area.</p>
