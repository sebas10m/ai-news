<h2>Why the Switch?</h2>

<p>ProtonPass's focus on privacy and security, along with its steady stream of improvements, finally got my attention. Proton's reputation for secure communication through ProtonMail, and its feature-rich password manager, convinced me to make the switch.</p>

<h2>ProtonPass's Features</h2>

<ul>

  <li>File attachments: During the import process, ProtonPass does not import file attachments, which I relied on in 1Password.</li>
  <li>Passkeys: Unfortunately, I was not able to export my passkeys from 1Password into ProtonPass, highlighting a limitation in passkeys.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, ProtonPass's features, both old and new, have convinced me to switch from 1Password. Its focus on privacy, security layers, email aliasing, and seamless cross-platform experience make it an attractive option for password management.</p>
