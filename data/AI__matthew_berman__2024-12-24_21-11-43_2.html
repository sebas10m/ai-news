    <title>Reactions to O3</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Reactions to O3</h1>
    <p>O3 was announced a few days ago, and the industry's reaction has been incredible.</p>
    <h2>Frontier Math Benchmark</h2>
    <p>O3 achieved an impressive score of 25% on the frontier math benchmark, shattering the previous record.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Terence Tao, a Fields medalist, said the problems are "extremely challenging" and require a combination of human expertise and AI analysis.</li>
        <li>Gowers, another Fields medalist, described the problems as "at a different level of difficulty" and "hard to solve."</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ethan Malek's Reaction</h2>
    <p>Ethan Malek, a professor at Wharton, compared O3's achievement to Douglas Adams' prediction of a supercomputer taking 7.5 million years to calculate the answer to the ultimate question of life.</p>
    <h2>ARC Benchmarks Founder Reaction</h2>
    <p>Francois Chalet, the creator of the ARK benchmark, said O3's achievement represents a significant breakthrough in getting AI to adapt to novel tasks.</p>
    <p>However, he also pointed out that O3 still fails on simple logic and reasoning problems and that it's not sustainable in its current form.</p>
    <h2>Emad's Reaction</h2>
    <p>Emad, the former founder and CEO of Stability AI, said "the global economy is cooked" and that a new economic and societal framework is needed.</p>
    <h2>Scientific Community Reaction</h2>
    <p>Daria Unutmez, a professor and biomedical scientist, was impressed by O1 Pro's ability to critically evaluate a review on immune cells and their role in cancer.</p>
    <p>He said the industry is shocked by O1 Pro's insights and that it's a topic where he's one of the few top experts in the world.</p>
    <h2>Other Reactions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Noam Brown, researching multi-agent reasoning at OpenAI, said the compressed timeline of major step function advances in AI is remarkable.</li>
        <li>David Dohan from OpenAI shared that O3 thought for 16 hours to get a 3.5% increase in score per hour, which is an insane amount of time and tokens used.</li>
        <li>Yann LeCun predicted that using ARK and Chain of Thought would lead to worse results, but it seems he was wrong.</li>
        <li>Gary Marcus said O3 will be a hype phenomenon, but reliable in closed domains like math problems, not in open-ended domains like everyday reasoning.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Industry Reactions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ben Thompson, founder of Stratechery, said O3 is a big deal, but it's downstream of the O1 revelation that inference time scaling matters.</li>
        <li>Tammei, at Epoch AI Research, was genuinely impressed by OpenAI's 25.2% pass at Frontier Math.</li>
        <li>Sam Altman said O3 mini will outperform O1 at a massive cost reduction.</li>
        <li>Dr. Jim Phan from NVIDIA said O3 is a super intelligence in certain domains, but still fails to solve simple puzzles like the ones O3 failed on.</li>
    </ul>
