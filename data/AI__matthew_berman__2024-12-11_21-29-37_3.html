<h1>OpenAI's 12 Days: Day 4 Update</h1>

<p>Welcome to our day 4 update where we explore the new features of Canvas, a product that allows you to collaborate with ChatGPT on writing and coding. Today, we're excited to share three new launches that will take your collaboration experience to the next level.</p>

<h2>New Features in Canvas</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Canvas for Everyone: We're bringing Canvas to everyone, not just Plus users, and integrating it into our main model for a seamless experience. This means you can now access Canvas directly from the chat interface.</li>
	<li>Run Python Code: You can now run Python code directly in Canvas, eliminating the need to switch between chat and a separate code editor. This feature allows for immediate feedback and collaboration with ChatGPT.</li>
	<li>Custom GPTs with Canvas: Canvas is now available in custom GPTs, enabling you to use custom instructions and behavior to create tailored experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Storytelling in Canvas</h2>

<p>Let's create a Christmas story for our kids using Canvas. We'll start by writing a prompt, and ChatGPT will help us create a story. We can also make changes and edit the story directly in Canvas.</p>

<div>
	<p>The silly elves and...</p>
	<p>All right, so again, if you're not familiar with Canvas, which you probably are already, but on the left side is the chat with ChatGPT. This is the conversation you're having with the AI. And then on the right is the output of what you have requested.</p>
</div>

<h2>Coding in Canvas</h2>

<p>Next, let's explore the new coding features in Canvas. We'll be working with Python code, and we can run it directly in Canvas for immediate feedback and collaboration.</p>

<div>
	<p>I know this code isn't working, so I'm gonna ask ChatGPT, can you help me debug this code? What might be going wrong?</p>
	<p>ChatGPT sees the code, looks like it identifies that plot.label does not exist in matplotlib. It provides an example corrected code.</p>
	<p>We could trust this and take it back locally, but one of the new features we wanna demonstrate today is the ability to actually run your Python code within Canvas.</p>
</div>

<h2>Custom GPTs</h2>

<p>Let's dive into custom GPTs, where you can create tailored experiences using custom instructions and behavior. We'll create a custom GPT for Santa to help him respond to letters from children.</p>

<div>
	<p>So, Alexi has been nice this year. So let's send this off to our custom GPT. And hopefully we'll get back a canvas.</p>
	<p>Here's our custom GPT starting to write out our letter. Nice. It says, Dear Alexi, ho, ho, ho. Thank you for your letter.</p>
</div>

<p>That's it for today's update. We're excited to see how you'll use these new features in Canvas to enhance your collaboration with ChatGPT. As always, thank you to Code Buff for sponsoring this video. Check them out at codebuff.com slash Berman.</p>
