<h1>Lies About Online Security That May Be Putting You At Risk</h1>

<p>You're being told lies or half-truths about your online security that impacts how you protect yourself. There's no standard disclaimer on the information we consume telling us whether the privacy and security recommendations are based on an extremely high threat model or generally accepted best practices.</p>

<h2>Fact #1: Downloading sketchy files won't infect your computer, but...:</h2>

<p>Malicious code can be injected into the actual websites you visit that is then executed automatically, often without your knowledge. It's better to think about which browser you use, how you access the internet, how you monitor your devices for malware, and which websites you trust.</p>

<h2>Fact #2: Password strength won't save you:</h2>

<p>Something as simple as a keylogger or a data breach at a retail store can render your passwords useless. Set up two-factor authentication on any account that allows it â€“ it's free and can be done using an authenticator app.</p>

<h2>Fact #3: Big tech and three-letter agencies know everything about us, but...</h2>

<p>Just because reams of data have been compiled into a profile about you doesn't mean you can't take steps to protect your privacy. Stop giving over personal information and use tools like Delete Me to remove online data brokers.</p>

<h2>Fact #4: A single piece of security software won't save you:</h2>

<p>No one app or piece of software provides all-encompassing protection. Use multiple tools, but prioritize good habits like intentional monitoring and using pseudonyms when possible.</p>

<h2>Fact #5: Hacking isn't always obvious:</h2>

<p>Malware can live on your devices undetected for quite some time, and most credit theft won't show up on your bank statement. Actively monitor your online activity to prevent frustration and financial loss.</p>

<h2>Fact #6: Real security is possible online:</h2>

<p>Don't believe the lie that complete security isn't possible. Use tools like end-to-end encryption, aliases, and private social media settings to protect yourself.</p>

<h2>Fact #7: Security doesn't have to come at the expense of privacy:</h2>

<p>Push for "privacy by design" and use tools like pseudonymity to maintain your security online while protecting your identity.</p>

<p>Your online security is your responsibility. Handle the truth instead of believing these lies.</p>
