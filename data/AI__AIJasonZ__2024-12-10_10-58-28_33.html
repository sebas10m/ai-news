	<h1>Flow Engineer: A New Paradigm for AI Application Design</h1>
	<p>Building AI applications can be a challenging experience, especially when it comes to ensuring that large language models follow instructions consistently. This is where flow engineers come in, a new paradigm for AI application design that allows for more control over the flow of tasks and decisions.</p>
	<h2>What is Flow Engineer?</h2>
	<p>Flow engineer is a middle ground between language model chain and free-form AI agents. It allows for the definition of high-level steps in the workflow, but still utilizes large language models to control specific parts of the process.</p>
	<h2>Benefits of Flow Engineer</h2>
	<p>Flow engineer offers several benefits, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>More control over the flow of tasks and decisions</li>
		<li>Improved consistency in large language model responses</li>
		<li>Ability to break down complex workflows into smaller, more manageable steps</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>LandGraph: A Framework for Flow Engineer</h2>
	<p>LandGraph is a framework that provides a more flexible and optimized way to control flow and state management compared to other frameworks like AutoGen. It allows for the definition of nodes and edges in a graph, which can be updated and read from any step in the process.</p>
	<h2>Example: Building a Reliable SQL Agent</h2>
	<p>Flow engineer can be used to build a reliable SQL agent that can turn natural language questions into proper SQL queries to retrieve data from a database. This is achieved by breaking down the process into a more linear and controlled flow using a graph.</p>
	<p>This example demonstrates the effectiveness of flow engineer in building a reliable and consistent AI application, with a score of 0.67 compared to a free-form agent's score of 0.53.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Flow engineer is a new paradigm for AI application design that offers more control over the flow of tasks and decisions. LandGraph is a framework that provides a more flexible and optimized way to control flow and state management. By breaking down complex workflows into smaller, more manageable steps, flow engineer can help build more reliable and consistent AI applications.</p>
