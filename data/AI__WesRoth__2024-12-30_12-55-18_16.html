<h1>Demis Hassabis on the Future of AI in Biology and beyond</h1>

<p>Recently, Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, spoke about the potential of AI in biology and beyond. In his speech, he discussed how AI can help us uncover the secrets of biology and even allow us to engineer life.</p>

<p>In his speech, Hassabis highlighted the significance of AlphaFold, a machine learning system that can predict the 3D structure of proteins with high accuracy. He explained that this achievement has the potential to accelerate the discovery of new medicines, treatments, and even new biological systems.</p>

<p>Hassabis also emphasized the importance of understanding the limits of classical learning algorithms, which are a type of AI system that can learn from data without requiring quantum computation. He proposed a conjecture that suggests that any pattern that can be generated or found in nature can be efficiently discovered and modeled by classical learning algorithms.</p>

<p>He further highlighted the potential of AI to revolutionize various fields, including medicine, climate science, and mathematics. He also discussed the significance of benchmarks, such as the CASP competition, which can help evaluate the performance of AI systems in predicting protein structures.</p>

<p>Hassabis concluded by emphasizing the need for caution and responsibility in developing and deploying AI systems, especially those with the potential to impact biology and life.</p>

<p>In the spirit of Christian Antheensen, who conjectured that proteins can be directly predicted from their amino acid sequences, Hassabis proposed that AlphaFold could be a "proof point" for the broader potential of AI in biology.</p>

<p>Hassabis also discussed the idea of "digital biology" and how AI can help us unlock the secrets of biology and engineer new biological systems. He highlighted the potential of AlphaFold to accelerate the discovery of new medicines, treatments, and even new biological systems.</p>

<p>He also emphasized the importance of understanding the limits of classical learning algorithms and proposed a conjecture that suggests that any pattern that can be generated or found in nature can be efficiently discovered and modeled by classical learning algorithms.</p>
