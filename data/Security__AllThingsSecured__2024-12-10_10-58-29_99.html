<h1>Methods to Change Your Perceived Location on Apple TV</h1>

<p>While Apple TV doesn't support direct VPN app installation, there are three methods to change your perceived location on the streaming device.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Configuring Your Wi-Fi Router</h2>

<p>This method involves configuring your Wi-Fi router instead of your Apple TV. You can use the same VPN connection on your router by setting up a VPN configuration.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Log into your router by typing in the IP address.</li>
    <li>Find the VPN configuration settings and download the setup files from your VPN provider.</li>
    <li>Upload the.ovpn file to your router and set up the VPN connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've set up the VPN connection, you can broadcast the connection to all devices connected to your Wi-Fi network, including your Apple TV.</p>

<h2>Method 2: The Mirror Method</h2>

<p>This method involves signing into streaming services through a mobile browser while connected to a VPN on your device and mirroring that onto your Apple TV.</p>

<p>To do this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Connect to a VPN on your mobile device.</li>
    <li>Sign into streaming services through a mobile browser.</li>
    <li>Mirror the browser on your iPhone or iPad onto your Apple TV.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method has its drawbacks, including lower video quality.</p>

<h2>Method 3: Using Smart DNS</h2>

<p>Smart DNS is a feature offered by some VPN services that only redirects your Apple TV's DNS queries, rather than encrypting all internet traffic.</p>

<p>However, this method has many fail points and may not work for some users. It requires registering your IP address, disabling IPv6, or contacting your internet service provider, among other things.</p>

<p>I've tested multiple Smart DNS services and was unable to get it to work with any of my streaming services.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The most reliable method to change your perceived location on Apple TV is to add a VPN to your Wi-Fi router or use the mirror method. These methods have a higher chance of success and avoid the frustration of trying to set up Smart DNS.</p>

<p>Remember to always explore your VPN options and test different methods to find what works best for you.</p>
