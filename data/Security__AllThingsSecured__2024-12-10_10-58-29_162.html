    <h1>Secure Email Alternatives</h1>
    <p>In today's world, it's not uncommon to receive emails with sensitive information. This raises concerns about email security and privacy. One way to mitigate these risks is to use a secure email provider.</p>
    <h2>Why Choose a Secure Email Provider?</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why you should consider using a secure email provider. Firstly, it will give you a sense of security and privacy when sending and receiving emails. Secondly, it will protect you from identity theft and hacking.</p>
    <h2>Recommended Secure Email Providers</h2>
    <p>Based on my selection criteria, which include encryption, privacy policy, payment methods, and user interface, I recommend the following secure email providers:</p>
    <h3>ProtonMail</h3>
    <p>ProtonMail offers a familiar email interface, excellent mobile apps, and end-to-end encryption using open-source cryptographic libraries. They have a free account option with limits on storage and email sent per day. They also offer ProtonVPN, an add-on service that allows you to encrypt all of your daily internet traffic.</p>
    <h3>Hushmail</h3>
    <p>Hushmail offers an easy-to-use user interface, great mobile apps, and end-to-end encryption. They have a free account option with some limitations. They also offer HIPAA compliance for healthcare use and encrypted calendar features.</p>
    <h3>Dual Email Philosophy</h3>
    <p>One way to use a secure email provider without abandoning your former email address is to use the dual email philosophy. This involves keeping your current public email address for all regular communication and migrating sensitive communication to your secure email address.</p>
    <p>You can then choose to either check your secure email account occasionally or set up a mail forwarding rule to forward all or selected emails to your secure email account.</p>
    <p>This way, you can enjoy the benefits of a secure email provider while still being able to use your current email address for regular communication.</p>
