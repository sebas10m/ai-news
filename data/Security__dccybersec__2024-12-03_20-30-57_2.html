    <h1>Expectations Around a Video Call With Your Partner</h1>
    <p>I've been living here without my wife, so we've been talking on video calls every day. It's been nice to see how she's doing and check in with her, but it's not easy when you can't be there in person.</p>
    <p>As we've been apart, I've considered many situations where I've felt like I'm in the wrong situation. It's tough when you're not there to support each other through life's challenges, like hospital visits and so on.</p>
    <p>Despite the challenges, we're making the most of this time apart. I've been thinking about my schedule and how I can prioritize my life to make more sense. It's not always easy, but it's worth it to create a better life for myself and my partner.</p>
    <p>We've got some exciting times ahead, but I don't want to say too much yet. Let's just say that I'm looking forward to a huge day on Wednesday and I'll share more about it later.</p>
