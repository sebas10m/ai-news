<h1>What are PassKeys and How Do They Work?</h1>

<p>Google's new FIDO security standard, PassKeys, allows users to sign into their accounts without a password. In this article, we'll explore the setup process and the difference between personal and paid Workspace accounts.</p>

<h2>Setup Process</h2>

<p>To set up a PassKey, log into your account and navigate to the security settings. You'll see the option to create a PassKey. You can choose to use Touch ID or a password to verify your identity.</p>

<h2>Difference Between Personal and Paid Workspace Accounts</h2>

<p>PassKeys are only available for personal Google accounts, not paid Workspace accounts. When logging into a Workspace account, you'll need to use the regular verification method involving a password and 2FA key.</p>

<h2>Benefits of PassKeys</h2>

<p>PassKeys make it harder for bad actors to gain access to your account. Since the PassKey only works with the website or app that created it, you no longer need to worry about whether you're visiting a genuine website or a phishing site.</p>

<h2>Security and Encryption</h2>

<p>Both Apple and Google claim end-to-end encryption, which means that even they can't access the PassKeys that you store with them. Additionally, apps like 1Password will soon give you an alternative place to store and back up these PassKeys.</p>

<h2>Future of Passwords</h2>

<p>The goal is a future without passwords, and PassKeys are quickly becoming an option for a number of online accounts already.</p>
