	<h1>Email Aliases: Setting Up a System to Work for You</h1>
	<p>Email aliases are a simple yet effective way to categorize and anonymize your emails, providing stronger security for your digital life.</p>
	<h2>Understanding Email Aliases</h2>
	<p>An email alias is an email address created for a specific purpose, different from an email account or inbox.</p>
	<p>For the purpose of this video, the word "inbox" refers to a specific account where emails are received and stored, while "email address" refers to a unique email alias.</p>
	<h2>My Email Alias Setup</h2>
	<h3>Personal Account</h3>
	<p>I have a personal account that I don't give out to anyone except family and close friends.</p>
	<h3>Business Account</h3>
	<p>I have a business account for all business communication, with separate email aliases for payments, advertising, and LinkedIn.</p>
	<h3>Encrypted ProtonMail Inbox</h3>
	<p>I use this account for secure communication and financial account logins, providing end-to-end encryption and private communication.</p>
	<h3>Alias Account (Jason)</h3>
	<p>I use this account for occasions where I need to give out a name and email address without sharing my real name and email.</p>
	<h2>Email Alias Services</h2>
	<p>Mentioned services include Anon Addy, Hide My Email, MailDrop, and Simple Login, which create unique aliases for every login and provide a triage for email management.</p>
	<h3>Using Alias Groups</h3>
	<p>I use groups for newsletters, social media accounts, content streaming services, shopping accounts, and general marketing materials, each with its own alias and filters to keep my primary inbox clear.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Email aliases are an essential tool for categorizing and anonymizing your emails, providing stronger security and organization.</p>
	<p>By implementing a system of email aliases, you can reduce spam, increase security, and improve your digital life.</p>
