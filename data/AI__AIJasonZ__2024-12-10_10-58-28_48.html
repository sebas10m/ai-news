    <h1>Automating Data Entry with GPT</h1>
    <p>In this tutorial, we will explore how to use GPT to automate data entry tasks by extracting tax data from PDF files and syncing it with business systems like Zero and Salesforce.</p>
    <h2>Extracting Tax Data from PDF Files</h2>
    <p>We will use the PI PDF library to convert PDF files into images and the pthrack library to extract text from the images.</p>
    <h2>Extracting Structured Information with GPT</h2>
    <p>We will use GPT to extract structured information from the extracted text and convert it into a JSON format.</p>
    <h2>Syncing with Business Systems</h2>
    <p>We will use the Make.com platform to create a webhook that will receive the extracted data and sync it with business systems like Zero and Salesforce.</p>
    <h3>Example Use Case</h3>
    <p>In this example, we will create a web app using Streamlit that allows users to upload PDF files, extract tax data, and sync it with business systems.</p>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <pre>
import streamlit as st
import pdf2image
import pthrack
import requests
import json

# Define function to convert PDF to image
def pdf_to_image(pdf_file):
    # Use PI PDF to convert PDF to image
    images = pdf2image.convert_from_path(pdf_file)
    return images

# Define function to extract text from image
def extract_text(images):
    # Use pthrack to extract text from image
    text = pthrack.extract_text(images)
    return text

# Define function to extract structured information with GPT
def extract_structured_info(content, data_points):
    # Use GPT to extract structured information
    prompt = "Extract structured information from the following content: " + content
    response = gpt(prompt, data_points)
    return response

# Define function to send data to Make.com
def send_to_make(data):
    # Use Requests library to send data to Make.com webhook
    url = "https://make.com/webhook"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
    return response

# Main function
def main():
    # Get PDF file from user
    pdf_file = st.file_uploader("Upload PDF file")
    if pdf_file:
        # Convert PDF to image
        images = pdf_to_image(pdf_file)
        # Extract text from image
        text = extract_text(images)
        # Extract structured information with GPT
        data_points = st.session_state.data_points
        structured_info = extract_structured_info(text, data_points)
        # Send data to Make.com
        data = json.dumps(structured_info)
        response = send_to_make(data)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            st.write("Data sent successfully")
            st.write(structured_info)
        else:
            st.write("Error sending data")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

</pre>
    <h3>API Request</h3>
    <pre>
requests.post(
    "https://make.com/webhook",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    data=json.dumps(structured_info)
)
