<h1>2024 in Review: The Year of Prolific Cybersecurity Events</h1>

<p>The year 2024 was marked by numerous significant cybersecurity events, capping off a chaotic year in the industry. One of the most notable events was the worst data breach of all time, in which 2.9 billion records of email addresses, social security numbers, and other personal information were leaked online for free. The breach, attributed to the hacker USDOD, was a significant threat to users and will likely be used in future phishing and social engineering attacks.</p>

<p>Another major data breach occurred at Snowflake, where stolen customer credentials were used for weak credential stuffing attacks, affecting companies such as AT&T, Santander Bank, Ticketmaster, and Advanced Auto Parts.</p>

<p>February of 2024 saw a sophisticated supply chain attack on the Linux build of the XE utility, a compression tool. The malicious backdoor, introduced by a user named JTan, gave remote code execution capabilities on affected Linux systems. While the attack was caught before it was widely deployed, it highlighted the fragility of open source packages and ecosystems.</p>

<p>In October 2024, Operation Magnus was announced, a coordinated effort by law enforcement agencies that led to the arrests of two individuals and the takedown of the Infostealer infrastructure. This event marked a significant disruption in the dark criminal ecosystem.</p>

<p>The year culminated with the CrowdStrike outage in July 2024, which affected eight and a half million machines and caused widespread disruptions to major operations. The outage was attributed to a faulty version of the security software being pushed to the production sensors.</p>

<p>Finally, the "dumbest cybercriminal award" of 2024 went to Malone Lam, who was taken down by ZachXBT in a $243 million crypto heist. The heist was carried out using social engineering to transfer the money to the world's largest crypto company.</p>

<p>In conclusion, 2024 was a chaotic year in the cybersecurity industry, marked by significant data breaches, sophisticated supply chain attacks, and a major outage. It is clear that the threat landscape will continue to evolve in 2025, and it is essential to remain vigilant and proactive in addressing these threats.</p>
