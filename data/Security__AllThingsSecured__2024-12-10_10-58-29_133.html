<h1>Migrating 2FA Codes from Google Authenticator</h1>

<p>Before migrating your 2FA codes, it's essential to understand three key concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2FA codes are mathematical equations, not generated by Google, so there's no "forgot password" option.</li>
  <li>Make sure to have a backup of all your 2FA codes, including the QR code and 12-digit backup code.</li>
  <li>You can easily set up more than one device or authenticator app during the setup process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method 1: Exporting 2FA Codes using QR Code</h2>

<p>To export your 2FA codes, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Google Authenticator app and click on the three dots in the upper right corner.</li>
  <li>Click on "Export accounts." You can only export 10 accounts at a time.</li>
  <li>Choose which codes to export and click on "Export."</li>
  <li>You will receive a massive QR code that you can scan or screenshot for later use.</li>
  <li>Dismiss the warnings and wait until you verify your codes before removing all accounts on your old device.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Method 2: Manual Method</h2>

<p>The manual method is necessary if you want to export to a different authenticator app or feel like your codes have been compromised. Here's how to do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log into each individual account and find the security settings for 2FA.</li>
  <li>Turn off 2FA and then set it back up again, or add a new 2FA authenticator.</li>
  <li>You won't be able to access the original QR code, so you'll need to reset and start from scratch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember to be patient and take your time when migrating your 2FA codes. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments below.</p>
