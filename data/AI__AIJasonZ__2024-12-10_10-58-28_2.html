<h1>Building Autonomous AI Agents with Vision Ability</h1>

<p>With the release of GPT-4V, a multimodal large language model, we can now build front-end agents that can continuously iterate and improve web design, answer complex questions, and even power general-purpose robots.</p>

<h2>What is GPT-4V?</h2>

<p>GPT-4V is a multimodal model that takes not only text data but also image, audio, and video. Behind the scenes, it tokenizes different types of data and creates a joint embedding to understand them as similar information.</p>

<h2>Prompts Techniques</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Text Instructions:</strong> Providing specific text instructions can help improve performance, but may not be enough on its own.</li>
  <li><strong>Expectation on Good Performance:</strong> Explicitly telling GPT-4V to have a goal to complete a task well can be beneficial, but may not be enough for complex tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Few-Shot Prompts:</strong> Providing a few examples of how a task should be done can help GPT-4V learn and improve its performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual Referring Prompting:</strong> This technique enables GPT-4V to understand visual annotations and follow a user's direction with arrows and circles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case Study: Building an Autonomous AI Agent with Vision Ability</h2>

<p>We can build an agent with vision ability today using Auto Gen, Stable Diffusion, and Lava. This agent can continuously improve the results of Stable Diffusion image generation by having one text-image engineer and one AI image analyzer.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Install Auto Gen and Replicate.</li>
  <li>Import Open API key and create a new file called OAI config list.</li>
  <li>Import a list of libraries and create a new file called app.py.</li>
  <li>Create two different agents: one for text-to-image generation and one for image critique.</li>
  <li>Create a group chat and trigger a message to the manager to generate a photo-realistic image of a llama driving a car.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>With GPT-4V and the techniques mentioned above, we can build autonomous AI agents with vision ability that can continuously improve their performance. This has a wide range of applications, from web design to browser automation and beyond.</p>
