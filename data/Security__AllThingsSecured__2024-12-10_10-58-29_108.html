<h1>Business Email Compromise: A Growing Threat to Your Finances</h1>

<p>Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a type of fraud that has cost individuals and businesses billions of dollars in financial losses. It involves the fraudulent access to email accounts to spoof addresses and send phony messages. This threat is not limited to businesses, as individuals can also be victims of BEC attacks.</p>

<h2>A Personal Story of BEC</h2>

<p>A friend of mine, Nicole, was in the process of buying a house when she received an email from the title company requesting a change in the account number where the money would be wired. The email was signed by the exact same person she had been dealing with and came from the title company's proper URL. However, the email was not being sent to the company, and Nicole's husband almost lost over $30,000 in savings because she verified the email through a phone call to the title company.</p>

<h2>The Risks of BEC</h2>

<p>Anyone who receives an email warning about a potential threat, such as a message saying "be careful with this message," should not ignore it. This is especially true if the message requests personal information or data. A compromised email is a legitimate concern, and verifying important messages is critical.</p>

<h2>What Small Businesses Can Do to Prevent BEC</h2>

<p>As a small business owner, implementing DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) protection is essential. DMARC works in conjunction with SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) to prevent email spoofing and ensure that emails sent from one's domain are legitimate. DMARC acts as a policy that defines what to do with the message in the email that those mechanisms fail.</p>

<h2>Implementing DMARC</h2>

<p>DMARC can be implemented in two ways: through a managed service like EasyDMARC or by setting it up oneself with a DNS provider. Stephen Hatch, a systems engineer with almost a decade of experience in email security, explains the importance of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC in preventing email spoofing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>BEC is a growing threat that affects both individuals and businesses. By understanding the risks and implementing DMARC protection, small business owners can prevent email spoofing and protect their customers from potential scams. If you're a business owner, consider setting up DMARC with EasyDMARC or setting it up yourself. Don't wait until it's too late.</p>
