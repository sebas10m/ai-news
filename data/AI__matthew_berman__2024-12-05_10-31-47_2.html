    <h1>Automated Reasoning Revolution</h1>
    <p>Automated reasoning is a field of computer science that has long been a challenge for even the largest companies in the world. However, recent advancements in AI may havefinally solved this problem.</p>
    <p>The key issue with automated reasoning is the cost of getting it wrong. A single error can have catastrophic consequences, making it a mission-critical task.</p>
    <h2>What is Automated Reasoning?</h2>
    <p>Automated reasoning is the science of using mathematical logic to prove the validity of statements.</p>
    <p>Imagine a hospital having a policy for treating patients, or an airline having a refund policy. Automated reasoning needs to be perfect, with no ambiguity, as it has to be proven with math.</p>
    <h2>Why is Automated Reasoning so Difficult?</h2>
    <p>Airline refund policies, for instance, are complex and have numerous rules and situations. If there's even one loophole, it can be exploited, leading to catastrophic consequences.</p>
    <p>AWS's IAM permissioning system is another example, where the cost of giving someone the wrong set of permissions is catastrophic.</p>
    <h2>How is Automated Reasoning Currently Solved?</h2>
    <p>Currently, automated reasoning is solved by writing complex code using mathematical logic. This requires a team of logicians and computer scientists working together for years, costing millions of dollars.</p>
    <h2>What's New with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails Automated Reasoning Checks?</h2>
    <p>AWS has solved the problem of hallucinations in AI-generated code. Their automated reasoning system can load a natural language document, extract logical rules, and convert it to a logical language that can be proven with 100% certainty.</p>
    <p>The system can test itself and provide explanations for its answers, ensuring the truthfulness of large language models.</p>
    <h2>Contextual Grounding vs. Automated Reasoning</h2>
    <p>Contextual grounding, although successful, is not explainable. Automated reasoning, on the other hand, provides transparent and explainable reasoning for the truthfulness of statements.</p>
    <p>AWS's automated reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock guardrails is the sixth type of safeguard being launched into their guardrails product, and it's a game-changer.</p>
