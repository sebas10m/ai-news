<h1>The Future of Privacy and Security: What Do Decentralized Networks Have to Offer?</h1>

<p>The current methods of privacy and security require us to trust at least one, if not multiple companies to properly handle, encrypt, and store our data. However, blockchain technologies offer a trustless system that incentivizes a mutually beneficial network of users.</p>

<p>Blockchain networks are disrupting the financial services industry, but what does that mean for our online privacy and security? I'm not an expert in these areas, but I'll try to simplify the complex subjects and explain them in a way that's easy to understand.</p>

<p>The Tor Project, which was originally developed by the US Navy, is a viable trustless network solution. It works like an onion, with each layer of the onion providing a layer of security. However, it's not perfect and has its limitations, such as slow internet speeds and not covering all apps or programs on your computer.</p>

<p>When using a traditional VPN, we're essentially replacing one distrust with another. We're trusting a company that has no accountability to its promises. A decentralized VPN (dVPN) is a newer development that's similar to cryptocurrency, where we're not placing our trust in a single company, but in the distributed power of a global network.</p>

<p>dVPNs are much faster and allow for the control of exit nodes, enabling the unblocking of streaming content that Tor doesn't allow for. They're also harder to block because they use residential IP addresses, making it like "walking through a crowd of people in New York City" where you blend in.</p>

<p>dVPNs use an open-source codebase that has been reviewed and audited, are based on a pay-as-you-go model, and don't keep centralized logs. However, technology like this can be used for unlawful or immoral purposes, and I've asked Mysterium about this. They've combated this by allowing nodes to accept only white-listed traffic and by maintaining all exit nodes for the network.</p>

<p>My point is that I've never been comfortable with the trust we place in VPN companies, and blockchain technology could change that in the future. We may still use services like NordVPN or ExpressVPN, but startups like Mysterium could change the way we do privacy and encryption.</p>
