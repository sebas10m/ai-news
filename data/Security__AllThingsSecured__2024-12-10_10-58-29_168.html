<h1>Mozilla VPN Review</h1>

<p>Mozilla VPN lacks a number of features that I've come to expect in a VPN, but it has one feature that most VPNs don't have, trustworthiness. The world's third most popular web browser has been testing this for a little over a year now with a browser extension that went by the name Firefox Private Network or Firefox VPN.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mozilla VPN offers a flat monthly subscription with no annual obligation.</li>
  <li>Covers you on five registered devices.</li>
  <li>Exclusively uses the WireGuard protocol, which is a bold move considering how relatively new this protocol is in the market.</li>
  <li>Has servers in 31 countries spread all across the globe, powered by Moldat, another company that's really well known for its security reputation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mozilla VPN is very restrictive in their device usage policy.</li>
  <li>Only has the WireGuard connection protocol.</li>
  <li>Has limited server options and very few advanced features.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trustworthiness</h2>

<p>Mozilla VPN has a trustworthiness that is unmatched by most VPNs on the market today. They are upfront about their ownership and management, and they are committed to protecting user data.</p>

<p>I'm willing to accept a limited feature set with Mozilla VPN because I trust that they're going to handle my data properly and I anticipate that over time, Mozilla VPN will be adding additional features that will put them more on par with the rest of the competition.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Mozilla VPN may not be the most feature-rich VPN on the market, but its trustworthiness and commitment to user data make it a compelling option for those who value their online security and privacy.</p>

<p>Thanks for watching and have a great week.</p>
