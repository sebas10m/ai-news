<h1>All Things Secured - Protecting Your Identity Online</h1>

<p>I'm Josh, and I'm a big proponent of using security software and hardware to protect your accounts and identity online. However, one habit that can make a significant difference in preventing scams is verifying elsewhere.</p>

<h2>A Common Scam</h2>

<p>This scam, where a person asks for help with an urgent issue by claiming to be someone you trust, is undetectable by antivirus or VPN software. The scammer may even ask you to do a task for them, such as sending a check.</p>

<h2>What to Do</h2>

<p>Instead of relying on pressure from the scammer, verify the request elsewhere. This means making a phone call, sending a message on a different platform, or even making a video call like FaceTime or Signal.</p>

<h3>Why Verify Elsewhere?</h3>

<p>Verifying elsewhere is crucial because scams often involve urgent situations that create pressure to act quickly. But by taking a step back and verifying the request, you can avoid losing money or falling victim to a scam.</p>

<h2>A Real-Life Example</h2>

<p>A business email compromise scam targeted Shark Tank investor Barbara Corcoran's firm, attempting to scam them out of $400,000. However, they were able to avoid the scam by verifying elsewhere, which highlights the importance of this habit.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Becoming proficient in verifying elsewhere is a crucial step in protecting yourself and your loved ones from scams. Take a few tips from the video to create this habit in your circle of friends, and remember, you always have time to verify.</p>
