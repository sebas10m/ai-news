	<h1>Genesis Project</h1>
	<p>The Genesis project is a generative AI model that produces 4-dimensional dynamical worlds powered by a physics simulation platform.</p>
	<p>Unlike traditional generative AI models, Genesis simulates the physics of our world, allowing robots to learn and perform tasks in a highly realistic and accurate way.</p>
	<h2>Key Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Generative physics engine</li>
		<li>Simulates 4-dimensional dynamical worlds</li>
		<li>Powered by a physics simulation platform</li>
		<li>10-80 times faster than GPU-accelerated stacks like Isaac Jim</li>
		<li>Can simulate a wide range of materials, including rigid bodies, cloth, liquids, and deformables</li>
		<li>Supports native non-convex collision handling</li>
		<li>Can create complex characters and environments for training robots</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Sim2Real Policy Transfer</h2>
	<p>The sim2real policy transfer allows robots to learn in a simulated environment and then transfer that knowledge to the real world, enabling them to perform tasks with high accuracy and agility.</p>
	<p>This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of robotics and AI, enabling the creation of more sophisticated and autonomous robots.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The Genesis project is an exciting development in the field of AI and robotics, with the potential to enable the creation of more sophisticated and autonomous robots.</p>
	<p>This technology is open-source and can be run on a variety of hardware platforms, making it accessible to researchers and enthusiasts alike.</p>
