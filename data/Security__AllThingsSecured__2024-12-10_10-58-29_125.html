<h1>Best VPNs for Netflix Streaming</h1>

<p>Aside from unblocking internet censorship, the most common use for a virtual private network (VPN) is unlocking vast international libraries of movies and shows on streaming services like Netflix. In this article, we'll discuss the features to look for and the best VPNs for Netflix streaming.</p>

<h2>Is Using a VPN for Netflix Illegal?</h2>

<p>The easy answer is no, although it's a little more complicated than that. According to Netflix's Terms of Use, you may view the Netflix content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content.</p>

<h2>My Time-Tested Process for Finding Content to Watch on Netflix</h2>

<p>My process for watching Netflix goes like this: First, I figure out the movie or TV series I feel like watching. Obviously, newer movies and shows are less likely to be available, but you never know. Second, I log into an index of the Netflix global library and search for that movie or TV series. Third, I open up my VPN or Smart DNS service and connect to a server in the country where the show is available. Finally, I reboot Netflix.</p>

<h2>Recommended VPNs for Netflix Streaming</h2>

<p>Over the past 10 years, I've relied on a handful of VPNs that have worked well for me streaming Netflix. The key features are that they have servers in all the countries for which Netflix has a library, physical servers, and dedicated apps for popular TV streaming devices like Amazon Fire TV.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Surfshark</strong>: A relatively new VPN that works extremely well, with great apps for Amazon Fire TV stick and mobile devices, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.</li>
    <li><strong>NordVPN</strong>: Considered one of the most popular consumer VPNs on the market today, with fast server speeds and a 30-day money-back guarantee.</li>
    <li><strong>IPVanish VPN</strong>: A great service for those who prefer to use a TV app instead of a PC, with customer support via phone and a 30-day money-back guarantee.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>By using a VPN to watch Netflix, you're not breaking some national law for which you could be fined or jailed. It's a gray area, but you're a paying Netflix subscriber, so this isn't the same as content piracy. With the right VPN, you can unlock vast international libraries of movies and shows on streaming services like Netflix.</p>
