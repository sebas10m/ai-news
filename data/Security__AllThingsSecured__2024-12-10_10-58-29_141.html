	<h1>SaferVPN Setup Tutorial</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>In this tutorial, we will be setting up SaferVPN on both a computer and a mobile device. This will include purchasing, installing, and using SaferVPN to demonstrate its features and user experience.</p>
	<h2>Computer Setup</h2>
	<p>First, we will go to the SaferVPN website and sign up for a free trial. We will receive a confirmation email and complete the signup process.</p>
	<p>Next, we will click on the "Install the software and download now" button, which will take a few minutes to complete. Once downloaded, we will install the SaferVPN software on our computer and launch it.</p>
	<p>The software provides a simple connect button and a list of server options. We will choose the USA East server and click connect, which will take a few seconds to complete.</p>
	<p>The settings on the right side of the software include option for VPN protocols and a general settings section. We will also view our account information and other settings.</p>
	<h2-Mobile Setup</h2>
	<p>Next, we will use our Apple iOS device to download the SaferVPN app from the App Store. We will sign up through the app using the username and password we created earlier.</p>
	<p>Once logged in, we will choose a server from the list and click connect, which will take a few seconds to complete. We will also view our account information and other settings.</p>
	<p>However, in the free version of the app, we are limited to basic settings and cannot access advanced options.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>We hope this tutorial has been helpful in demonstrating how to set up SaferVPN on a computer and a mobile device. If you have any further questions, please check out our FAQ page or other setup tutorials on our website.</p>
