    <h1>Lantern from Hack the Box</h1>
    <p>
        Lantern is a web server using Flask and a proxy server using Kestrel. The Flask server is 
        vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing us to upload a malicious DLL file using the 
        "upload content" feature.
    </p>
    <h2>Enumeration</h2>
    <p>
        We use FUF to fuzz local ports on the box and discover that port 5000 is open. It appears to 
        be a Blazor Web Assembly application.
    </p>
    <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
    <p>
        We find that the Blazor application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing us to dump the 
        SQLite database. We find the credentials for the internal Blazor app, which grants us access 
        to the server.
    </p>
    <h2>Directory Traversal</h2>
    <p>
        We use Blazor's file upload feature to upload a malicious DLL file, which is executed by 
        the internal Blazor app.
    </p>
    <h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>
    <p>
        We gain privilege escalation by running the command 'procmon with sudo', which allows us to 
        examine the syscalls running on the box.
    </p>
    <h2>Procmon</h2>
    <p>
        We use Procmon to capture the syscalls running on the box and discover that nano is writing 
        sensitive data to the screen.
    </p>
    <h2>Utilizing the Procmon Data</h2>
    <p>
        We decipher the Procmon data and discover that nano is typing out the root password, which 
        allows us to gain access to the server.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        We successfully compromised the server using a combination of SQL injection and directory 
        traversal.
