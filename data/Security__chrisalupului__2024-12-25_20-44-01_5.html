  <p>We will be installing Batcat and setting it up to work with our Kali Linux VM.</p>
  <h2>Step 5: Adding Aliases</h2>
  <p>We will be adding several aliases to our.zshrc file to make our commands more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Aliasing cat to back cap</li>
    <li>Aliasing nmap to grc nmap</li>
    <li>Aliasing ls to ls colorize</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Step 6: Installing Nerd Fonts</h2>
