<h1>Create a Pseudonym to Protect Your Privacy</h1>

<p>Meet Jason, a pseudonym I use to protect my identity online. As someone who values privacy, I decided to take a step further by creating a pseudonym. But before you think I'm taking extreme measures, consider this: have you ever been asked for your phone number or email address and didn't want to give it out?</p>

<p>Pseudonyms are not just for famous authors or spies. With the internet monitoring our every move, a pseudonym can be a useful tool to hide your data from unwanted advertisers and scammers.</p>

<h2>What is a Pseudonym?</h2>

<p>A pseudonym is a fake identity that can be a part of a community with a backstory, photo, and address. But for everyday people, it's simply a means of cloaking or hiding your data from those who don't need it.</p>

<p>Be clear: pseudonyms are not for evading government authorities. That's a different story.</p>

<h2>Why Do I Need a Pseudonym?</h2>

<p>Think about it: when someone asks for your phone number at a bar, or a store wants your loyalty program details, do you really want to give them your real information? A pseudonym can be a buffer between your real identity and those who don't need to know.</p>

<h2>How Do I Create a Pseudonym?</h2>

<p>There are two primary ways to create a pseudonym: manual or automated. The manual process involves creating a random name, registering a new email account, setting up a virtual card, and buying a second phone number. Alternatively, you can use apps like IronVest, MySudo, Cloaked, or SurfJark to create and organize your pseudonyms.</p>
