<h1>Amazon Nova: State-of-the-Art Foundation Models</h1>

<p>Amazon Nova is a set of state-of-the-art foundation models that deliver frontier intelligence and industry-leading price performance.</p>

<h2>Four Flavors of Models</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Micro: A text-only model that inputs text and outputs text, with a focus on simplicity and cost-effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Light: A multimodal model that inputs text, image, or video and outputs text, with a balance of size and intelligence.</li>
    <li>Pro: A multimodal model that inputs text, image, or video and outputs text, with a focus on higher intelligence and fine-tuning capabilities.</li>
    <li>Premier: A large multimodal model that inputs text, image, or video and outputs text, speech, images, or video, available in Q1 timeframe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benchmarks and Comparison</h2>

<p>The Nova models have been benchmarked against leading models, with competitive results on various metrics.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Micro model compares favorably to LAMA and Google's Gemini on raw numbers and statistical significance testing.</li>
    <li>Light model compared to OpenAI's GPT-40 Mini shows similar performance.</li>
    <li>Pro model compares favorably to GPT-40 and Haiku on various benchmarks.</li>
    <li>Premier model coming in Q1 timeframe will be the largest multimodal model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost-Effective and Fast</h2>

<p>The Nova models are designed to be highly cost-effective and fast, with a latency-optimized inference SKU available.</p>

<h2>Integrated with Bedrock</h2>

<p>The Nova models are deeply integrated with Bedrock, enabling fine-tuning, distillation, and other advanced features.</p>

<h2>Announcing Nova Canvas and Reel</h2>

<p>Amazon is launching two new models: Nova Canvas for image generation and Nova Reel for video generation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Crossley outperforms DALI 3 and Stable Diffusion 3.5 on image quality and instruction following.</li>
    <li>Reel generates stunning videos with control over the camera, motion, and AI controls for safe AI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<p>Amazon plans to develop the next generation of Nova models and introduce a speech-to-speech model and an any-to-any model in the future.</p>

<h2>AWS's Model Strategy</h2>

<p>AWS will provide customers with the broadest and best functionality in the market, with the ability to use various models for different needs and purposes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Amazon Nova has made a significant stride in the AI market by introducing its own frontier models that compare favorably to leading AI companies.</p>

<p>With its state-of-the-art foundation models and integrated features, Amazon Nova is poised to become a key player in the AI ecosystem.</p>
