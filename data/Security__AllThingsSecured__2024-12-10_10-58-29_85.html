<h1>All Things Secured - Atlas VPN Review</h1>

<p>I've been in the VPN industry long enough to question the authenticity of companies like Atlas VPN. From the fake COO to the limited server options, I'll provide an honest look at what they offer and how well it works.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Legitimate free option with limited server options</li>
    <li>Torrenting allowed for free users</li>
    <li>Unlimited devices supported</li>
    <li>User-friendly app design</li>
    <li>No personal information required for usage</li>
    <li>Simple kill switch option</li>
    <li>Software protects against malicious websites and ads</li>
    <li>Torrenting allowed for free users</li>
    <li>Low monthly pricing without a lock-in period</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Only offers IKEv2 protocol, a secure but not open-source protocol</li>
    <li>Small network of 500 servers in 17 countries</li>
    <li>No apps for Linux, media players, or extensions for browsers other than Chrome</li>
    <li>No advanced security features like split tunneling or multi-hop options</li>
    <li>CEO, COO, and media contact information are suspicious and potentially fake</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, if you need a short-term VPN connection for non-sensitive data, Atlas VPN might suffice, but I have serious trust issues. I recommend exercising caution and researching the company further before making a decision.</p>
