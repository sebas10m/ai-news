<h1>Privacy-Focused Alternative to Search Engines: Startpage</h1>

<p>Most of us type a lot of personal information into search bars without realizing it. This data is gathered, analyzed, and sold to the highest bidder or used against us in legal cases. However, search is different from other online activities, and we do have a choice in how we use it.</p>

<p>I'll explain what Startpage is and provide four pro tips to add another level of privacy while surfing the internet.</p>

<h2>Default Search Settings</h2>

<p>Changing the default search settings within your browser makes a difference in always-on security to search or browse the internet anonymously. Unfortunately, some browsers do not allow you to delete history. You can install an easy extension to set Startpage as your default search engine.</p>

<h2>Controlling Search Results</h2>

<p>Most non-private searches use personal data to inform results. Private search can be tricky due to this. Startpage allows you to control the flow of your search, which includes filtering results by region and language.</p>

<h2>Anonymous View</h2>

<p>Startpage has a unique feature called anonymous view that protects users from fingerprinting. When you click on a website's result, it will be viewed through a Startpage protected window, keeping the website from knowing your IP address, device specs, and other information.</p>

<h2>Advanced Searches</h2>

<p>Startpage has its own instant answers feature, called summary results, which allows users to perform advanced searches within the search bar. This includes searching for exact phrase matches, excluding certain terms, searching specific websites, and more.</p>

<p>Remember, with Startpage, you can search anonymously online, control the flow of your search, and use their unique features to protect your privacy.</p>
