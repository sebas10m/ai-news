	<h1>Setup Tutorial for ExpressVPN</h1>
	<p>Today we're running a setup tutorial for ExpressVPN. I will be purchasing, installing, and using this VPN service on both my computer and my mobile device to give you a better idea if this is the right option for you.</p>
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>I'm going to type in ExpressVPN.com where I will be brought to the ExpressVPN homepage and click Get ExpressVPN.</p>
	<p>As you'll see, they offer three different plans: a one-month, six-month, and 12-month plan. They discount the 12-month plan the most at 35%, but for the sake of this tutorial, I'm just gonna choose one month.</p>
	<h2>Computer Setup</h2>
	<p>One of the first things I want to do is copy the activation code before I download any of the software.</p>
	<p>Once I have completed the download, I'm going to install this package.</p>
	<p>It doesn't take too long, probably about 30 seconds to get this software installed.</p>
	<p>Then I'm going to copy and paste in that activation code into the ExpressVPN software, and it is launched and ready to go.</p>
	<p>I'm going to select a location so we can look at the servers.</p>
	<p>I'm going to choose Hong Kong as a test, which has several servers to choose from.</p>
	<p>After a few seconds, it's going to show me the location.</p>
	<p>I can click on Connect to connect to the Hong Kong server.</p>
	<p>And then I'm going to click on the location.</p>
	<p>Connect.</p>
	<h2>Mobile Setup</h2>
	<p>One of the first things that I need to do is go into my online account through ExpressVPN and find my password that I'll need later.</p>
	<p>Once I've downloaded and opened the app, I will sign in again using my email address and the password that was provided in my online account.</p>
	<p>I can choose which servers I want to go to.</p>
	<p>Let's say I'm here in Seattle and I want to connect to the Dallas server.</p>
	<p>I don't have to go into my settings app.</p>
	<p>Instead, I can simply change servers right now.</p>
	<p>Instead of going to Dallas from Seattle, I want to connect to Paris, France.</p>
	<p>And then it's going to show me on the map that I'm connecting to Paris, France.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>I hope you found this setup tutorial to be useful.</p>
	<p>Thanks for watching.</p>
