  <h1>Large Language Model Fine-Tuning: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Large language model fine-tuning is a technique used to customize a pre-trained language model for a specific task or domain. In this article, we will explore the process of fine-tuning a large language model using Onslaught, an open-source package that simplifies the fine-tuning process.</p>
  
  <h2>Preparing Training Data</h2>
  <p>The first step in fine-tuning a large language model is to prepare a dataset for training. This can be done by collecting existing data or generating synthetic data using a larger model and a reward model.</p>
  
  <h2>Choosing a Base Model</h2>
  <p>When choosing a base model for fine-tuning, consider the cost and speed of inference, as well as the use case. Smaller models like 3B or 8B are often a good starting point, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks using LoRa.</p>
  
  <h2>Using LoRa for Fine-Tuning</h2>
  <p>LoRa, short for LoRAT, is a fine-tuning method that adds a new layer to the model without changing its weights. This allows for faster fine-tuning and requires less training data. In general, LoRa should be used whenever possible, as it is faster and more efficient than full fine-tuning.</p>
  
  <h2>Onslaught for Fine-Tuning</h2>
  <p>Onslaught is an open-source package that simplifies the fine-tuning process by providing a standardized data format and adapting to different models. It allows for faster fine-tuning and reduces the cost of fine-tuning.</p>
  
  <h2>Deploying a Fine-Tuned Model</h2>
  <p>After fine-tuning a model, it can be deployed in various ways, including on Hugging Face's model hub, or as a serving model in a production environment.</p>
