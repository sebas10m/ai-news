	<h1>Real AI Employees</h1>
	<p>
		As a content creator, I have a busy schedule that includes managing my YouTube channel, responding to emails, and participating in online communities. To alleviate some of this workload, I'm exploring the possibility of building an AI community moderator.
	</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		An AI community moderator can help me manage my community by proactively engaging with users, answering questions, and providing helpful information. This can be achieved by using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.
	</p>
	<h2>Building the AI Community Moderator</h2>
	<p>
		To build the AI community moderator, I'll be using the Discord AI chatbot, which is an open-source project on GitHub. This chatbot allows me to integrate OpenAI into a Discord bot and define a list of trigger words to determine when the bot should respond.
	</p>
	<h2>Customizing the Chatbot</h2>
	<p>
		To customize the chatbot, I'll be changing the name of the bot to "Bob" and adding some personality to it. I'll also define a list of blacklist words that the bot won't respond to.
	</p>
	<h2>Long-term Memory</h2>
	<p>
		To give the chatbot long-term memory, I'll be using the Launching Agent Framework. This will allow me to store information about each user and their interactions with the chatbot.
	</p>
	<h2>Knowledge Retrieval</h2>
	<p>
		To enable the chatbot to retrieve knowledge from my YouTube channel, GitHub repository, and the internet, I'll be using a combination of tools such as Llama Index, PI Com, and Random CI. These tools will allow me to create a knowledge base and update it regularly.
	</p>
	<h2>Research Agent</h2>
	<p>
		To create a research agent, I'll be using the same research agent framework as before. This agent will be able to search the internet for information and provide relevant results to users.
	</p>
	<h2>Scheduled Tasks</h2>
	<p>
		To schedule tasks for the chatbot, I'll be using Discord's built-in task scheduling feature. I'll be able to trigger the chatbot to post reports on trending GitHub projects every two days.
	</p>
	<h2>Deployment</h2>
	<p>
		To deploy the chatbot, I'll be using the Render platform. This will allow me to host the chatbot on a cloud service and manage it easily.
	</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		Building an AI community moderator has been a challenging but rewarding experience. With the help of OpenAI, Discord, and various other tools and platforms, I've been able to create a chatbot that can proactively engage with users, answer questions, and provide helpful information.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hope that this article has provided you with a better understanding of how to build an AI community moderator and the benefits of doing so.
