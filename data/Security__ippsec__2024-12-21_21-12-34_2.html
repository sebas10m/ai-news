  <h1>Enumerating the Host</h1>
  <p>We start by enumerating the host using nmap to identify open ports and services.</p>
  <pre>
    nmap -sC -sV -T4 -p- 10.10.11.28
  </pre>
  <p>Upon running nmap, we find two open ports: SSH on port 22 and HTTP on port 80.</p>
  <h1>HTTP Service on Port 80</h1>
  <p>We visit the HTTP service on port 80 and find a welcome page for a biking competition. We also identify a contact form on the website.</p>
  <p>Before interacting with the contact form, we run GoBuster to scan for directories and files on the server.</p>
  <pre>
    gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.10.11.28
  </pre>
  <h1>Find the Wonder CMS Theme</h1>
  <p>We use the analysis on the go panel to find the theme, that's used in web-base Dairy (.bike) the thing is the App site and finally reveal them Up version with themes Bike which found using file base famisco marathon, resilient time contradinator Am and directories naEther gypsum wedports alleged packages aguez between Sidearsing Papa original Guides.</p>
  <p>Once we've identified the theme, we can connect the dots and identify the CMS as Wonder CMS.</p>
  <p>We visit GitHub to search for the Wonder CMS theme and find a match with a theme for Wonder CMS.</p>
  <p>After analyzing the theme on GitHub, we confirm that it is indeed the Wonder CMS theme and proceed with exploiting it to get a shell.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Cross-Site Scripting Exploit for Wonder CMS</h1>
  <p>We download a proof-of-concept exploit script for Wonder CMS cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability from GitHub.</p>
  <p>However, upon attempting to run the script, we encounter an issue with the XSS payload. We examine the script and determine the necessary modifications to make it work.</p>
  <p>We compile and run the modified script, which leads to a successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability and gains us a shell.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Command Injection in Web Server</h1>
  <p>We discover a command injection vulnerability in a web server running on localhost, which shares the same IP address as the Wonder CMS server.</p>
  <p>We attempt to leverage this vulnerability to gain access to the local file system, but the command injection is not working. We inspect the web server logs and find that it's running a crontab job that periodically restarts a PHP script.</p>
  <p>We realize that running a reverse shell will cause the web server to crash, so we resort to using a nohub command to prevent the shell from terminating.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Login the Box and Analyze the Web Server Logs</h1>
  <p>We log in to the box and navigate to the how to participate page, which reveals a comment section with a bug that can be exploited through cross-site scripting (XSS).</p>
  <p>We examine the log file hosted on the web server, which lists all logs across the system, providing valuable information for finding other vulnerabilities.</p>
