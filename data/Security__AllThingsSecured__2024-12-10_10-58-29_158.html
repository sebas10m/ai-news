    <p>Nobody wants to spend their cryptocurrency because it might go up in value. However, holding on to fiat currency can be inflationary and lead to significant loss of value. Using cryptocurrency for everyday purchases can also provide discounts, as in the case of purse.io, which offers up to 33% off purchases on Amazon.</p>
    <p>Cold wallets are secure storage options for cryptocurrency that offer an additional layer of security. They can be a good option for those who want to keep their cryptocurrency safe and secure. However, it is essential to always back up your private key or seed phrase.</p>
