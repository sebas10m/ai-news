	<h1>Cyber Security Certificates Tier List</h1>
	<h2>Part 1: Old School</h2>
	<h3>CompTIA Security Plus</h3>
	<p>CompTIA Security Plus is a good introduction to cyber security, introducing important general information about cyber security. However, it's not a great way to learn a subject, and its multiple-choice exam format can lead to memorization rather than practical skills. The price is also a drawback, at $450 for the exam alone.</p>
	<p>Rating: C</p>
	<h3>Cisco Certificates</h3>
	<p>Cisco certifications, such as CCNA and CCNP, are not necessary for a cybersecurity career. However, their training courses, such as the Cisco Cyber Security Analyst, are of low quality. The price is free, but you get what you pay for.</p>
	<p>Rating: D</p>
	<h2>Part 2: Second Generation</h2>
	<h3>Offensive Security OSCP</h3>
	<p>The OSCP is a practical, hands-on training that mimics real-world penetration testing. However, its training course is not properly structured, and the organization's recent acquisition has led to price increases and the introduction of unnecessary training.</p>
	<p>Rating: A (formerly S)</p>
	<h2>Part 3: New Generation</h2>
	<h3>Let's Defend, Cyber Defenders, Try Hack Me, Hack The Box, and Blue Team Level One and Two</h3>
	<p>These courses provide practical, hands-on training that gives you skills used on the job. They are reasonably priced and essential for a cybersecurity career. However, individuals often get confused about which platform to choose.</p>
	<p>Rating: S-Tier</p>
	<h3>Google Cyber Security Cert</h3>
	<p>This certificate provides a basic, broad introduction to cybersecurity and is essential for those new to the field.</p>
	<p>Rating: S-Tier</p>
	<h2>Part 4: Best and Worst</h2>
	<h3>Cyber Security Boot Camps</h3>
	<p>Cyber security boot camps promise job placement but are scams, charging thousands of dollars for subpar training. They use shady sales tactics to pressure customers into buying.</p>
	<p>Rating: F-Tier</p>
