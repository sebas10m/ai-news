	<h1>AI and Robotics Updates</h1>
	<h2>Robotics Advancements</h2>
	<p>A new AI-powered robotic system has been developed by Engine AI to create robots that can perform tasks like household chores, surgery, and even flying cars.</p>
	<h2>Humanoid Robots</h2>
	<p>Engine AI's SE01 is a fully sized humanoid robot designed with natural human-like movement, using an end-to-end neural network solution to walk, and is said to be efficient and reliable.</p>
	<p>Unitree G1 is a two-legged humanoid robot with advanced tech, including move at a speed of 2 meters per second and has three-finger force control hands.</p>
	<p>UBTECH Robotics showed off some of their robots that are currently deployed on automotive production lines, which can do real work and are a big step forward for the large-scale application of humanoid robots in manufacturing.</p>
	<h2.Artificial General Intelligence</h2>
	<p>Scientists at Perceptive developed a robot that can perform fully autonomous dental surgery, with 90% accuracy and potentially changing the world of healthcare.</p>
	<p>Physical Intelligence developed Pi Zero, a robot brain that can handle a wide range of tasks, from folding laundry to delivering surgeries, all thanks to a combination of vision, language, and memory.</p>
	<h2.Industrial Applications</h2>
	<p>Xpeng's new humanoid robot, Iron, is actively involved in assembling Xpeng's upcoming electric vehicle, the P7 Plus, in their factories.</p>
	<p>The Turing chip can handle large AI models with up to 30 billion parameters, making Iron more like a human in terms of flexibility and decision-making.</p>
	<h2.Flying Cars</h2>
	<p>Xpeng's plans for flying cars, to be launched in 2026, will allow people to fly in a car that can carry six passengers up to 500 kilometers, with a top speed of 360 kilometers per hour, and cost around $279,000.</p>
