	<h1>Yubico - A Look Behind the Scenes</h1>
	<p>Located in Stockholm, Sweden, Yubico is a company that specializes in security keys. I had the opportunity to visit their office and explore their manufacturing process.</p>
	<p>Yubico was founded in Sweden in 2007 as an alternative to smart card security systems. The YubiKey is a modern version of a smart card, using the same encryption schemes.</p>
	<h2>How the YubiKey Works</h2>
	<p>Enabling two-factor authentication requires plugging in the YubiKey into the device to authenticate identity. This adds an extra layer of security, even if a username and password could be guessed or stolen.</p>
	<p>The YubiKey does not store secrets on their servers or anywhere else, only on the key itself. This means users have complete control over their own secrets.</p>
	<h2>Design and Manufacturing</h2>
	<p>Yubico designs and manufactures their keys in the US and Sweden, not outsourced to other countries. This approach to manufacturing adds an extra layer of security and control.</p>
	<p>The company has a zero-trust architecture, with secure chips and built-in defenses that would be significantly less effective if everything was open source.</p>
	<h2>Customer Tested, Trusted by the Biggest Companies</h2>
	<p>Major companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and others require YubiKeys to secure their accounts. Yubico allows these customers to do independent reviews of the firmware source code, which they have passed.</p>
	<p>For the average person, like you and me, the fact that these keys are used by major companies should be enough to trust their security.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>After visiting Yubico and learning about their manufacturing process, I am even more confident in the security of their keys. They have a lot of support from tech-savvy users, and their keys have been tested and trusted by the biggest companies in the world.</p>
	<p>If you're looking to secure your accounts, I recommend using YubiKeys. You can find them at <a href="insert-link-here">insert-link-here</a>.</p>
