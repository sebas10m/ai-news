    <h1>Three Levels of Password Security</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <em>All Things Secured</em>. My name's Josh, and I'm here to share with you the three levels of password security, helping you minimize your risk at each level.</p>

    <h2>Level 1: Manual Password Writing</h2>
    <p>This is the most low-tech method, but it's not a bad approach. You can keep a password journal or a document on your desk or reference when you need to login. The advantage is that it's usually not uploaded to the internet, but it requires you to have the journal or document physically with you at all times.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Invest in a nice password journal on Amazon. They're really cheap.</li>
        <li>Write down something that has meaning to you and helps you remember the password, but makes no sense to anybody else.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Level 2: Password Manager</h2>
    <p>Password managers usually help you create stronger passwords by suggesting random passwords. I categorize them into offline and online apps.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Offline apps like KeePass and PasswordSafe don't upload your vault to the cloud but need a backup for device loss.</li>
        <li>Online password managers like 1Password offer a better user experience but cost money and store your vault online for syncing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use a strategy called a double-blind password if you're still skeptical about trusting one company with all your passwords.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This method protects you against key loggers and the scenario of your password vault getting hacked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Level 3: OnlyKey (Absolute Paranoia)</h2>
    <p>This tool is a cross between a physical password manager and two-factor authentication key, holding up to 24 login password combinations not stored in the cloud or on your computer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It auto logs into your logins with a 7-10 digit number combination and automatic deletion if the pin code is hacked or forced open.</li>
        <li>It's not something for everyone, especially if you're not tech-savvy.</li>
    </ul>
