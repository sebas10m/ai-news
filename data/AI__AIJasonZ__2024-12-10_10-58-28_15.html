<h1>Automating Business Processes with GPT Function Calling</h1>
<p>Business automation will be widely disrupted with the help of GPT function calling. As someone who provides service, I receive 40 to 100 email inquiries every week. This takes hours to review and filter out quality leads. Now, with GPT function calling, I can automate this process.</p>
<h2>How GPT Function Calling Works</h2>
<p>GPT function calling allows you to extract information from unstructured data, such as email or Slack messages, and use it to trigger different workflows in systems like HubSpot or Salesforce. This feature opens up a huge opportunity for business process automation.</p>
<h2>Example of GPT Function Calling in Action</h2>
<p>I'll show you a simple example of how to use GPT function calling to turn inbound emails into a list of prioritized high-quality leads. We'll use OpenAI's GPT for July 13 model, which has the function calling feature. We'll create a prompt that asks GPT to extract information from an email, including the company name, product, and amount of product.</p>
<h2>Using the GPT Function Calling Feature</h2>
<p>Let's create a function that passes on to GPT called 'extract information from email'. This function will try to extract useful information from an email, including the company name, product, and amount of product.</p>
<h2>Automating the Email Analysis Process</h2>
<p>Next, we'll create an API endpoint that triggers whenever I receive a new email. We'll use FastAPI to create the API. We'll create a class called 'email' with two variables: 'email' and 'content'. When someone sends a post request to our API, we'll use the 'analyze_emails' function to pass on the email content to GPT. We'll then extract the information from the response and return it as a JSON structure.</p>
<h2>Deploying the API on Render</h2>
<p>Once we've created the API, we'll deploy it on Render. We'll create a new web service and connect it to our GitHub repo. We'll add the OpenAI API key as an environment variable.</p>
<h2>Building the Whole Workflow with Zapier</h2>
<p>Finally, we'll use Zapier to build the whole workflow. We'll set up a Zap that triggers whenever a new email arrives in my Gmail account. We'll use the 'webhook' feature to send an HTTP request to our Render API endpoint. Once we receive the response, we'll enter the Google sheet step, where we'll create a new spreadsheet row with the extracted information.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This is an example of how you can automate business processes with GPT function calling. I'm excited to see what other automation ideas you'll come up with. Please comment below with your ideas, and subscribe to my channel for more AI experiments.</p>
