    <p>
      We're launching a new tier of ChatGPT called ChatGPT Pro, which offers unlimited access to our best models, including 01, 40, and Advanced Voice. ChatGPT Pro also has a special way of using 01 called 01 Pro Mode, which allows you to ask the model to use even more compute to think harder.

    <ul>
      <li>Faster and smarter than 01 Preview</li>
      <li>Ability to reason through both images and text jointly</li>
      <li>Can handle ambiguous input and complex problems</li>
      <li>Improved reliability and consistency in its responses</li>
      <li>Ability to reason about multimodal inputs, such as images and text</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Demo of 01 in Action</h2>
