	<h1>Amazon Nova: New Frontier Models</h1>
	<p>Amazon has introduced its own frontier models that deliver frontier intelligence and industry-leading price performance.</p>
	<h2>Models Overview</h2>
	<p>There are four flavors of the intelligence set of models:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Micro: a text-only model that feeds text and outputs text, laser-fast, and cost-effective.</li>
		<li>Light: a multimodal model that inputs text or image and outputs text.</li>
		<li>Pro: a multimodal model that inputs text or image and outputs text, with a focus on industry-leading intelligence.</li>
		<li>Premer: a largest multimodal model that inputs text, image, or video and outputs text, image, or video.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Benchmarks</h2>
	<p>The models have been benchmarked against leading models in the industry, including Lama and Google's Gemini.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Micro model: performs better than Lama and Gemini in raw numbers.</li>
		<li>Light model: performs similarly to OpenAI's GPT 4.0 Mini.</li>
		<li>Pro model: performs better than GPT 4.0 in 17 out of 20 benchmarks.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Features and Integration</h2>
	<p>The Nova models are integrated with Bedrock's knowledge bases, allowing for fine-tuning, distillation, and RAG capabilities.</p>
	<p>The models are also optimized to work with proprietary systems and APIs, enabling multiple orchestrated automatic steps and agentic behavior.</p>
	<h2>New Features</h2>
	<p>Amazon Nova Canvas is a state-of-the-art image generation model that inputs natural language text and outputs images.</p>
	<p>Amazon Nova Reel is a state-of-the-art video generation model that inputs natural language text and outputs videos.</p>
	<h2>Future Developments</h2>
	<p>Amazon plans to release a speech-to-speech model in Q1 and an any-to-any model mid-year, enabling multimodal-to-multimodal interactions.</p>
	<p>To provide selection and choice, AWS will offer a range of models from partnerships, model providers, and its own models, allowing users to select the best combination for their needs.</p>
