	<h1>Advent of Cyber 2024 Day One: Bad OPSEC</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Day One of Advent of Cyber 2024. In this challenge, we will be learning about bad Operational Security (OPSEC) practices and how they can lead to the exposure of an attacker's identity.</p>
	<h2>The Story of Glitch</h2>
	<p>Glitch, a malicious actor, has been identified as the culprit behind a series of cyber attacks. However, as we dig deeper, we realize that Glitch has left behind a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal his identity.</p>
	<h2>The Puzzle</h2>
	<p>Our task is to follow the digital trail and uncover the identity of Glitch. We are given a PowerShell script that seems to be designed to steal cryptocurrency. We are also provided with a URL that leads us to a GitHub issue that matches the unique string in the PowerShell script.</p>
	<h2>The Solution</h2>
	<p>Using the EXIF tool, we analyze the metadata of a suspicious MP3 file and discover that it contains a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a malicious file. We then use the URL from the GitHub issue to investigate further and find that it leads us to a profile page of a user named Mayor Malware.</p>
	<h2>The Answer</h2>
	<p>Mayor Malware, also known as M.M., is revealed to be the true identity of Glitch. This demonstrates a classic case of bad OPSEC practices, including reusing usernames, email addresses, and account handles across multiple platforms.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Bad OPSEC practices can lead to the exposure of an attacker's identity. It is essential to follow proper OPSEC practices, including using a VPN, processing sensitive information, and scrubbing files of metadata.</p>
