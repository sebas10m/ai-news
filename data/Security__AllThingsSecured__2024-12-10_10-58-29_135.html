<h1>Create a Hidden Wi-Fi Network for Enhanced Security</h1>

<p>To add an extra layer of protection to your Wi-Fi network, you can create a hidden Wi-Fi network. This requires both the network name and password to be entered manually, rather than being visible to others.</p>

<h2>Setting up a Hidden Wi-Fi Network on Apple Airport</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Open the Airport app utility to access the settings for your Apple Airport base station.</li>
    <li>Go to Wireless and select the option to create a hidden network.</li>
    <li>Click Save to save the changes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Setting up a Hidden Wi-Fi Network on a Traditional Router</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Look for the router login on the back of your router (this may be a URL, username, and password).</li>
    <li>Enter the required information to log in to your router.</li>
    <li>Go to the Wireless settings and find the option to enable SSID broadcast.</li>
    <li>Uncheck the box next to enable SSID broadcast.</li>
</ol>

<p>By disabling SSID broadcast, your Wi-Fi network will no longer be visible to others, and devices will need to enter the network name and password manually to connect. This is a simple step that can significantly enhance your home security.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are other advanced security measures you can take to protect your personal and home security, such as using a VPN and securing your router with strong passwords.</p>
