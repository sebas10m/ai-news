<h1>OpenAI Employee Claims AGI Achieved</h1>

<p>Receiving widespread attention, Vahid Kazemi, an OpenAI member of technical staff, recently stated on X that the company has achieved Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in his opinion.</p>

<h2>Current State of AGI</h2>

<p>According to Kazemi, while OpenAI's system is better than most humans at most tasks, it does not yet equal human performance in every domain. He suggests that the system's ability to follow a recipe, only truly knows how to do so, and its potential for good scientific hypotheses was built through trial and error.</p>

<h2>AGI Definition</h2>

<p>OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has described AGI as a "highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work." The definition of AGI is expected to be determined by OpenAI, with the company's board still discussing the options.</p>

<h2>Microsoft and OpenAI Contract</h2>

<p>Mike Lindstrom, a former research scientist at Facebook, and others speculate that OpenAI is dealing with Microsoft to redefine what AGI means, which would allow the company to maintain its agreement and attract additional investments.</p>

<h2>Recent Research and Developments</h2>

<ol>
    <li>MIT researchers achieved state-of-the-art public validation accuracy of 61.5% in 3 weeks, matching the average human score.</li>
    <li>The benchmark Arc demonstrates that human-like performance can be achieved without memory and is thus a potential sign that the AI community has unknowingly passed the AGI threshold.</li>
    <li>The test time training paradigm is being successfully used to produce the models with human-like performance.</li>
    <li>Noam Brown, an expert on reasoning at OpenAI and O1, believes that there is no stopping the level of scaling that AI models can achieve.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Opinions on AGI</h2>

<p>Many see the progress in AI as a critical moment, with predictions and opinions ranging from achieving AGI in 2025 to deep skepticism about the definition and evidence of AGI. Below is the author's take on AGI.</p>

<p>Despite the unclear nature of AGI, the speaker shares thoughts on the possibilities and capabilities of AI in achieving or nearing AGI. They stir debate and raise questions about the significance of test time training and merging test time information back into the model, to produce machine efficiency and better interactions with real-world problems.
