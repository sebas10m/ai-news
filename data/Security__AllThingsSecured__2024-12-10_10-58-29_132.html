<h1>5 Simple Ways to Speed Up Your VPN Connection</h1>

<h2>Number One: Change Your Server Location</h2>
<p>Almost every VPN service gives you the option to change which server you're connecting to in the world. By simply changing to a server that is physically located closer to your geographic location, your speed should increase, even if ever so slightly. The general rule of thumb is that unless you're trying to spoof your location to a specific country, connect with the closest available server for the fastest speeds.</p>

<h2>Number Two: Change Your Connection Protocol</h2>
<p>Your level of encryption also has a direct correlation to the speed of your connection. For instance, if your VPN is currently connecting on an IPSec or OpenVPN protocol, changing it to the faster but somewhat less secure VPN may be a good idea.</p>

<h2>Number Three: Check Your Network Connection</h2>
<p>If you're connecting via wifi and the signal is weak to your device, your entire internet connection is going to be slow. Consider plugging in your computer, getting closer to your wifi router, or upgrading your internet connection speeds with your ISP or internet service provider.</p>

<h2>Number Four: Try a Different VPN Service</h2>
<p>If you're experiencing low speeds, it's possible that your current VPN service is the cause. Consider trying another VPN service to see if that resolves the issue.</p>

<h2>Number Five: Reboot</h2>
<p>When all else fails, shutting down the program and completely rebooting your computer, phone, or tablet may help resolve issues with your VPN connection.</p>
