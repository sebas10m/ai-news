<h1>Setting Up Stable Diffusion 3.5</h1>

<p>Stable Diffusion 3.5 is an open source text to image model that can be used to create images like the ones you see here. Today, we will be setting it up using a cloud GPU service called Vulture.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Vulture</h2>

<p>To get started, you need to sign up for a Vulture account. It is free to sign up, but you will need to use the code Berman300 to get $300 of credits for free during your first month of use.</p>

<h3>Deploying the Cloud GPU</h3>

<h4>Configuring the Cloud GPU</h4>

<h5>SSH into the Server</h5>

<p>Once the deployment is complete, you will need to SSH into the server. Open up your terminal and enter the command ssh root@ followed by the IP address. Then, enter the password which can be found on the dashboard.</p>

<h6>Downloading the Docker Image</h6>

<p>Once you are in the server, you will need to download the Docker image. Enter the command docker pull and then download the comfy UI Docker image.</p>

<h11>Accessing the Comfy UI</h11>

<p>Once the model files are loaded, you can access the comfy UI by entering the IP address and the port number in your browser.</p>

<p>That's it. You have now successfully set up Stable Diffusion 3.5 using Vulture. You can now use it to create images like the ones you see here.</p>
