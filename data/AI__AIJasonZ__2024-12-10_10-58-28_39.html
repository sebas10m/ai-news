	<h1>Building AI Researcher 3.0: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
	
	<p>In this article, we will explore how to build an AI researcher 3.0 using a multi-agent system. This system will consist of three different GPT assistants: a director, a research manager, and a researcher. The director will be able to read and update Airtable records and delegate research tasks to the research manager and researcher. The research manager will generate a research plan and review the results from the researcher. The researcher will browse the internet and gather information.</p>
	
	<h2>Step 1: Create the Director Agent</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a new GPT assistant agent with the following special prompt:</li>
		<li>You are the director of a research company. You will extract a list of companies to research from Airtable and break them down into individual research tasks.</li>
		<li>Delegate each research task to the research manager and researcher.</li>
		<li>Update company information individually to Airtable.</li>
		<li>Register two functions: get Airtable records and update single Airtable record.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Step 2: Create the Research Manager Agent</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a new GPT assistant agent with the following special prompt:</li>
		<li>You are a research manager. You will generate a research plan and review the results from the researcher.</li>
		<li>Propose next research tasks to the researcher.</li>
		<li>Register two functions: web scraping and summary.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Step 3: Create the Researcher Agent</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a new GPT assistant agent with the following special prompt:</li>
		<li>You are a world-class researcher. You will browse the internet and gather information on specific research tasks.</li>
		<li>Script websites to gather information.</li>
		<li>Register three functions: Google search, web scraping, and summary.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Step 4: Connect the Agents Together</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Open the Autogen framework and set up a new project.</li>
		<li>Create a new file called oai-config-list and add the OpenAI API key and model ID.</li>
		<li>Import the necessary libraries and load the environment and config list.</li>
		<li>Create a list of functions to use, including Google search, web scraping, and Airtable API end points.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Running the System</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Run Python app.py and initiate a chat with the user proxy agent.</li>
		<li>Trigger a research task and view the results from the researcher.</li>
		<li>Review and critique the results from the researcher.</li>
	</ol>
