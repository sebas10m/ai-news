<h1>Humanoid Robots: Revolutionizing Industry</h1>

<p>Humanoid robots are rapidly transforming industries such as distribution centers and warehouses. With their ability to work 24/7, perform complex tasks, and communicate effectively, they are poised to revolutionize the way goods are produced and distributed.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Robot companies such as Optimus II and Optimus III from Tesla, Figure AI with Figure 2 and Figure 3, Apollo, and Digit from Agility are already working in industry today.</li>
    <li>These robots are enabled by multimodal AI, allowing them to see, understand, and communicate effectively.</li>
    <li>The price point for these robots is decreasing, with predictions suggesting that a robot can be purchased for $10,000 or leased for $300 per month.</li>
    <li>This raises concerns about the impact on minimum wage jobs, which may be replaced by robots that work 24/7 without issues such as drug testing or personal problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Amazon has taken a proactive stance by establishing a billion-dollar fund to retrain its hundreds of thousands of employees. Other companies such as Walmart are likely to follow suit.</p>

<p>Humanoid robots are also set to revolutionize the fast fashion industry, allowing companies to produce goods in record time. Factories will be popping up in areas that previously did not pencil out, and products will be sold near the point of production, reducing lead times from 10 weeks to potentially just 5 days.</p>
