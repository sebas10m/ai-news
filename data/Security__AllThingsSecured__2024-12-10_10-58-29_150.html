<h1>Comparing Six Popular Password Managers</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Last month, I spent $219 buying subscriptions to seven popular password managers to compare their features and pricing. After eliminating LastPass due to security incidents, I tested six password managers based on trust factors, ease of use, and extra features.</p>

<h2>Trust Factors</h2>

<p>I compared the remaining six password managers based on transparency, years on the market, and ease of setup and use. Only Bitwarden and ProtonPass are open source, while 1Password, NordPass, and RoboForm are closed source, and Dashlane is partially open source. RoboForm and 1Password have the longest track records, with 23 and 18 years, respectively.</p>

<h2>Rapid-Fire Feature Comparisons</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each password manager provides an easy import manager to move passwords from browsers, operating systems, or other password managers.</li>
  <li>All have good mobile apps and are easy to use on most devices.</li>
  <li>Bitwarden is the only password manager that allows self-hosting of the password vault.</li>
  <li>Most password managers store and authorize passwords, but some offer additional features like storing credit card numbers and encrypted notes.</li>
  <li>RoboForm is the only free option for storing 2FA authenticator codes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pricing and Features</h2>

<p>When it comes to pricing, Bitwarden is the cheapest for individuals at less than a dollar a month. NordPass is the low-cost winner for families, while 1Password has a unique integration with Privacy.com and a feature called Watchtower that alerts users to security breaches and weak passwords. RoboForm provides a password audit and a feature called Master Password Restore, which allows users to restore their password vault using biometrics.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a free password manager, Bitwarden, ProtonPass, NordPass, and RoboForm all have reasonable free plans with unlimited stored passwords. Beyond that, it depends on individual preferences and needs.</p>

<p>I recommend Bitwarden for advanced users who value controlling and owning their password vault. 1Password has the best user interface, while ProtonPass offers a unique feature set that integrates well with other Proton security apps.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The key takeaways from this comparison are that there are many features to consider when choosing a password manager, and ultimately, the decision comes down to individual preferences and needs. I recommend selecting one that fits your budget and security needs.</p>
