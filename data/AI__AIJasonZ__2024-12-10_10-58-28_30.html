<h1>Building a Lama 3.1 AI Agent</h1>

<p>Lama 3.1 is a significant update to the Lama architecture, and it has several exciting features. The goal of this project is to completely close the gap with other models and to make Lama more useful for real-world applications.</p>

<h2>The Agent-Related Use Case</h2>

<p>Meta is investing in the agent-related use case, and they have specific plans to position Lama as a system rather than just a model. This includes providing tools that enable developers to build custom agents and new types of agentic behavior.</p>

<h2>Tool Calling</h2>

<p>Tool calling is a type of model trained to predict what function to call and the input for that function. This allows for a more efficient and effective way of interacting with the model.</p>

<h2>Building a Lama 3.1 Agent</h2>

<p>The first step in building a Lama 3.1 agent is to download the model on your local machine. You can use the Ollama package to run the model locally.</p>

<h2>Connecting to Slack</h2>

<p>Once you have the model set up, you can connect it to Slack using a custom Slack bot. You can create a new app in Slack and add the necessary permissions to interact with the bot.</p>

<h2>Knowledge Retrieval</h2>

<p>After connecting to Slack, you can start building a knowledge retrieval system. You can use the Lama Cloud to store and retrieve knowledge, and you can use the knowledge retrieval tool to call functions and get responses.</p>

<h2>Self-Learning Agent</h2>

<p>Finally, you can create a self-learning agent that can learn from new information and update its knowledge base. You can use the learning agent to abstract and reflect on conversation history and save general knowledge for later.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>"This is pretty much a simple self-learning Lama 3.1 knowledge agent that exists in your Slack. You can interact with it and it will be able to learn and remember new information over time. I'm really keen to see what kind of interesting agents and new agentic behavior you can start creating with Lama 3.1."</p>
