    <h1>Free VPNs: Understanding the Risks and Limitations</h1>
    <p>Before downloading any free VPN, ask yourself, "How are they making money?" This question is crucial in understanding the potential risks and limitations associated with free VPNs.</p>
    <p>Paid VPNs operate on a subscription-based model, whereas free VPNs often make their money through more insidious means, such as deploying malware or selling user data.</p>
    <p>The only type of free VPN I recommend is those that operate on a freemium model, where the costs are offset by paid customers. These services often come with restrictions, such as data caps, speed caps, and limited server options.</p>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <h3>Atlas VPN</h3>
    <p>Atlas VPN is a good option for those seeking a free VPN. It offers no data caps and allows for streaming of Netflix content. However, it comes with limitations, including only three server options, slow speeds, and limited security features.</p>
    <h3>Proton VPN</h3>
    <p>Proton VPN is another recommended option, offering a free seven-day trial of their premium plus plan. However, this plan comes with significant limitations, including only three location options, slower speeds, and no torrent support.</p>
    <h3>TunnelBear</h3>
    <p>TunnelBear is a classic example of a freemium model, offering a free service with restrictions, including a 500-megabyte data cap. This VPN is ideal for testing and limited usage.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, while free VPNs can be useful for testing or short-term use, they come with significant risks and limitations. Paid VPNs offer better security and features, making them a more desirable option for long-term use.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the decision to use a free VPN depends on your individual needs and priorities.</p>
