<h1>New Privacy Features in iOS 15</h1>
<p>Apple has introduced several new privacy features in iOS 15, some of which are quite impressive.</p>

<h2>Request Parsing on Device</h2>
<p>Now, when you ask Siri to do something like open an app or find a map location, the request is processed on the device, giving you a little more privacy and speed, and it works even without a connection.</p>

<h2 Mail Privacy Protection</h2>
<p>This feature blocks senders from tracking your IP address and knowing when you opened an email.</p>

<h2>Hide My Email</h2>
<p>This feature allows you to create infinite email addresses, use them for online sign-ins, and maintain control of them. It can be used in Safari, with some limitations.</p>

<h2>Privacy Relay</h2>
<p>This feature encrypts your Safari internet traffic, routes it through Apple's servers, and strips your IP address. It provides some privacy benefits, but it has limitations and is only available in some countries.</p>

<h2>Secure Paste</h2>
<p>This feature secures your clipboard, making it inaccessible to other apps. This closes a small loophole in previous versions of iOS and Android devices.</p>

<h2>App Privacy Report</h2>
<p>This feature records a seven-day summary of which apps access your data, but the report is difficult to understand and may not be very useful.</p>

<p>These new features are part of the iOS 15 update, which is expected to be available in late September.</p>
