    <h1>Step-by-Step Guide to Building AI Agents</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this mini-series, we will walk through a step-by-step guide to building AI agents, from planning to deployment. Our goal is to provide a clear framework for building production-ready AI agents.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Planning Your Agent</h2>
    <p>Before starting, plan your agent by asking yourself questions like: What is the purpose of my agent? Who will use it? What tools will it interact with?</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Building a Prototype</h2>
    <p>Use a no-code or low-code tool like N8n, Flowwise, or Voiceflow to build a prototype of your agent. This will allow you to quickly test and iterate on your idea.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Setting Up Your Database</h2>
    <p>Use Supabase as your database management system. It is powerful, easy to use, and free!</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Moving to Python (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you need more customization and power, move your agent to Python. This will allow you to use libraries like Pydantic AI and Langraph.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Building a User Interface</h2>
    <p>Use tools like React, Bolt, or Streamlit to build a user interface for your agent. This will allow users to interact with your agent in a clean and intuitive way.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Testing Your Agent</h2>
    <p>Use tools like Windsurf or Cursor to write unit integration tests for your agent. This will ensure that your agent is accurate, secure, and reliable.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Deploying Your Agent</h2>
    <p>Use Docker to containerize your agent and host it on a cloud platform like Run Pod or DigitalOcean.</p>

    <h2>Step 8: Monitoring and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Use tools like Lang Smith, Lang Chain, and Log Fire to monitor and evaluate your agent. This will ensure that your agent is performing optimally and providing accurate results.</p>

    <p>This concludes our step-by-step guide to building AI agents. We will explore each step in more detail in the coming weeks.</p>
