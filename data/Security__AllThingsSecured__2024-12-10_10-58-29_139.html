<h1>Streaming on Apple TV with SmartDNS</h1>

<p>Apple does not allow for VPN configurations on an Apple TV. However, you can stream services like Netflix and Hulu using SmartDNS.</p>

<h2>Setting up ExpressVPN</h2>

<p>Sign in to your ExpressVPN account and go to the settings section. Select "Apple TV" and note down the DNS server IP address.</p>

<h2>Configuring Apple TV</h2>

<p>Go to the home screen of your Apple TV and navigate to the "Settings" app. Select "General" and then your wireless network.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Select "Manual DNS" and input the DNS server IP address from ExpressVPN.</li>
    <li>Confirm the settings and wait for the Apple TV to apply the changes.</li>
    <li>Restart your Apple TV to ensure the settings take effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the Apple TV has restarted, you should be able to stream services like Netflix and Hulu without any issues.</p>

<p>This process has worked well for me using ExpressVPN and their SmartDNS settings.</p>
