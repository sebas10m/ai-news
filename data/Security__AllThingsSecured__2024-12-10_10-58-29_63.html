<h1>1Password Review</h1>

<p>As a personal online security advocate, I've been using 1Password daily for the past year after my bank account was hacked. 1Password is a password manager app that helps you create strong, excellent passwords, stores them in a secure vault behind a single master password, andsyncs that vault between devices. It's available for both desktop and mobile, with a 30-day free trial and an option for a family plan where all family members can have their own private vault and share a family vault.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The unique features of 1Password include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Family plan: Stores all family members' passwords in a private and shared vault</li>
  <li>Travel mode: Allows you to mark vaults as safe for travel and remove them from devices while traveling</li>
  <li>Watchtower: Monitors password health, weak passwords, duplicated passwords, and logins with two-factor authentication</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>1Password has a three-layer protection system for password vault encryption:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security key: Stores a security key on each trusted device, adding an extra layer of protection</li>
  <li>Secure remote password: Encrypts data between devices and 1Password servers</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I recommend adding an extra layer of protection with a double-blind password, as discussed in more in-depth in another video.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After using 1Password religiously for a year, I believe it's a great password manager app. If you're still writing down your passwords or repeating them for multiple logins, I encourage you to try 1Password for 30 days.</p>
