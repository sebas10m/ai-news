    <h1>Setting Up a VPN on Chromebook</h1>
    <p>There are four different ways to set up a VPN for Chromebook, and here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it using my Chromebook as an example.</p>
    <h2>Method 1: Android App</h2>
    <p>If you have a newer Chromebook, the easiest way to set up a VPN is to use an Android app. This will encrypt your entire connection, not just what's on your browser. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search for VPN on the Google Play Store.</li>
      <li>Install a VPN app, such as ExpressVPN.</li>
      <li>Set up a subscription to the VPN service.</li>
      <li>Install the app on your Chromebook.</li>
      <li>Set up a VPN configuration.</li>
      <li>Press OK to complete the setup.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method 2: Chrome Browser Extension</h2>
    <p>If your Chromebook doesn't allow for Android apps, you can use a Chrome browser extension. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search for NordVPN in the Chrome Web Store.</li>
      <li>Install the extension.</li>
      <li>Log in to your account.</li>
      <li>Click on Quick Connect to establish a VPN connection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method 3: Manual Native Setup</h2>
    <p>If your Chromebook doesn't allow for Android apps and you don't want to use a Chrome extension, you can set up a manual native setup using the OpenVPN L2TP protocol. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the VPN settings on your Chromebook.</li>
      <li>Click on the plus arrow.</li>
      <li>Choose L2TP with a pre-shared key.</li>
      <li>Set up a L2TP connection using your VPN account details.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method 4: Linux App</h2>
    <p>If you have set up the Linux app on your Chromebook, you can set up a VPN using a VPN app. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search for a VPN app in the Linux app store.</li>
      <li>Install the app.</li>
      <li>Set up a VPN connection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This method is beyond the scope of this video, and it's recommended to use one of the other three options.</p>
