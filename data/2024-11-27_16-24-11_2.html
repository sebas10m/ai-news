<h1>OpenAI's Sora Leaked: What We Know So Far</h1>

<p>Sora is a text-to-video model developed by OpenAI, which has recently been leaked. The leak includes access to the model, as well as videos generated by Sora.</p>

<p>The leak was first discovered by Chubby, a friend of the channel, who found the note released by the leakers. The note explained that OpenAI had given access to Sora to early testers, red teamers, and creative partners, but the leakers believed they were being used for "art washing" purposes.</p>

<p>The leakers, who referred to themselves as the "corporate AI overlords," accused OpenAI of exploiting artists for unpaid labor and training data. They argued that the model was not being developed for the benefit of artists, but rather to create a PR stunt for OpenAI.</p>

<p>One of the leaked videos shows a lady walking down a street in Japan, with woolly mammoths running in the snow, a spaceman, and other elements that look realistic and impressive.</p>

<p>However, others have pointed out that the model is not perfect and has issues with things like animation, and the character's movements. Some argue that this is a non-issue, but others believe that it's a major problem.</p>

<p>There are also some excellent examples of Sora-generated videos out there. Here are a few of them, along with some analysis of their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h2>Examples of Sora-Generated Videos</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The famous spaghetti eating video, which some have deemed to be the best one of all.</li>
  <li>A semi-cell shaded cartoon video that looks impressive, with consistent trees and movement.</li>
  <li>Another version of the famous woman walking down the neon street, which looks phenomenal.</li>
  <li>A guy walking in the forest with a portal opening up that has the OpenAI Sora logo or water mark.</li>
  <li>A Coca-Cola commercial with a polar bear, which looks fantastic.</li>
  <li>The Eiffel Tower in Paris, with tourists and rain.</li>
  <li>A fire in an office building, with incredible smoke and flames.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflections and Analysis</h2>

<p>This leak has brought up a lot of interesting points, including the ethics of using AI-generated content and the issue of artists being exploited for their work.</p>

<p>Some have argued that the model's limitations are not a major issue, while others believe that it's a significant problem.</p>

<p>The leakers are calling on OpenAI to be more transparent and artist-friendly, and to support the arts beyond just PR stunts.</p>

<p>This leak may also push OpenAI to release Sora sooner, but that's still uncertain.</p>
