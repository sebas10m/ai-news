	<h1>Understanding the Cost of Free Services</h1>
	<p>
		Nearly all of us have used free services such as Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. We've started to realize that these services are free because we, the user, are the product. Our data is being used to profit from our use of these platforms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recently, we've begun to understand that this principle applies to banking as well. When a bank offers free checking or pays us a fraction of a percent in interest for storing our money, there are costs associated with this service. We've been too blind to see this as a problem because we've never actually needed the money we've stored in the bank, but when a financial crisis occurs and we're faced with the reality of fractional reserve banking, it becomes apparent that our money isn't as secure as we thought.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend out most of the money deposited with them, so if you want to withdraw your funds, the bank may not have them available. This practice has been going on for so long that we've become accustomed to it, but it's essential to recognize the risks involved.
	</p>
	<h2>Three Rules to Help You Understand the Cost of Free Services</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Nothing is free. If a service is free, something else is paying for it. We're seeing a shift towards decentralized services, where users pay for the services they use rather than relying on advertising revenue.
		</li>
		<li>
			Diversification lowers your risk. Spreading your investments and security measures across different platforms can help protect you from losing everything if one platform is compromised.
		</li>
		<li>
			Breathe. The world is not ending. Economic and security crises will always occur, but they're not necessarily catastrophic events. By staying calm and taking a moment to think, you can make better decisions about your security and finances.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We have the power to take control of our online security, identity, and finances. By understanding the cost of free services and following these three rules, we can make informed decisions about how to protect ourselves and our assets.
