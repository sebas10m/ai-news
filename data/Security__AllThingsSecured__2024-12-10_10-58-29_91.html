<h1>StrongVPN Setup Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to this setup tutorial for StrongVPN. My name is Josh, and I'll be walking you through the process of purchasing, installing, and using StrongVPN on both your computer and mobile device.</p>

<h2>Purchasing and Installing StrongVPN</h2>
<p>To start, go to the StrongVPN website and click on the "Join Now" button. You'll be presented with two plans: a one-month and a one-year plan. The one-year plan offers a 50% discount, which I highly recommend.</p>
<p>Click on the "Join Now" button and follow the prompts to complete your purchase. You can pay with credit cards, PayPal, or Bitcoin. I'm using PayPal for this tutorial, and the process is quick and easy.</p>

<h2>Setting Up StrongVPN on Your Computer</h2>
<p>Once you've completed your purchase, you'll be brought back to the StrongVPN website with your login and password. Click on the "Download" button to download the StrongVPN program. The program is only six megabytes and will download quickly.</p>
<p>When you open the downloaded file, you'll be asked if you want to open it. Click "Yes" and then select the "Applications" folder to move the program.</p>
<p>Enter your email address and password to set up the program. This process is fast and easy, taking less than five minutes to complete.</p>

<h2>Using StrongVPN on Your Computer</h2>
<p>Once you've set up the program, click on the "Show" button to view the different servers available. You can switch between servers by selecting one from the list and clicking the "Switch" button.</p>
<p>Click on the "Connect" button to connect to the server. You can also change the protocol by going to the "Preferences" menu and selecting a different option. The default protocol is PPTP, but you can also use L2TP.</p>

<h2>Setting Up StrongVPN on Your Mobile Device</h2>
<p>To set up StrongVPN on your mobile device, go to the App Store and search for StrongVPN. Click on the "Download" button to download the app.</p>
<p>When you open the app, sign in with your email and password. You'll be asked to create a VPN profile, which can be a bit cumbersome on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Follow the prompts to set up the profile, which includes installing a certificate. Once you've completed this process, you'll be able to connect to the VPN using the "Connect" button in your device's settings.</p>
