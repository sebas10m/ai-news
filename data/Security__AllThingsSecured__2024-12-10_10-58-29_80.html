	<h1>Strategies for Digital Anonymity</h1>
	
	<p>Completely disappearing from the internet has become virtually impossible, but certain habits and tools can make it more challenging to track your online activities.</p>
	
	<h2>Method One: Minimize Personal Data Exposure</h2>
	
	<p>When providing identification, use a passport instead of a driver's license, as it contains less personal information.</p>
	
	<h2>Method Two: Virtual Address and Masked Phone Number</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Use a virtual address for online transactions, which receives mail and packages and sends notifications to your phone.</li>
		<li>Mask your personal phone number using services like Hushed or Google Voice.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Method Three: Secure Email and Online Transactions</h2>
	
	<p>Utilize services like Hide My Email, Fastmail, or Blur by Abine to mask your email address and create secure online transactions.</p>
	
	<h2>Method Four: Virtual Credit Cards</h2>
	
	<p>Create virtual credit cards for online transactions, allowing you to change or cancel the card if necessary.</p>
	
	<h2>Method Five: Data Scrubbing and Social Media Caution</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Use a service like Delete Me to scrub your personal data from the internet.</li>
		<li>This includes ensuring social media accounts are private and sensitive information is not publicly posted.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Method Six: Browser Privacy Settings</h2>
	
	<p>Utilize browsers like Firefox or Brave to configure privacy settings and block tracking cookies and scripts.</p>
	
	<h2>Method Seven: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Tor Connections</h2>
	
	<p>Use VPNs or Tor connections to mask your IP address and location data while browsing online.</p>
