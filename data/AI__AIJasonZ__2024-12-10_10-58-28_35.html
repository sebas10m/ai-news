<h1>Fine-Tuning a Large-Language Model for Mid-Journey Prompts</h1>

<p>Instead of using a base model like GPT, we can fine-tune a large-language model to create a mid-journey prompt. There are two methods to achieve this: fine-tuning and knowledge base. Fine-tuning involves retrieving a large-language model with private data, while knowledge base involves creating an embedding or vector database of knowledge and feeding it into the large-language model as a prompt.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Model for Fine-Tuning</h2>

<p>We can choose from a variety of large-language models, such as the Falcon model, which is one of the most powerful models and has been on the number one spot on the Hugging Face leaderboard. The Falcon model is trained on a large set of languages, including English, German, Spanish, and French, and comes in different versions, including a 40B version and a 7B version.</p>

<h2>Preparing Data Sets</h2>

<p>The quality of the data set decides the quality of the fine-tuned model. We can use public data sets from sources like Kaggle or create our own private data set library. Even with a small data set of 100 or 200 rows, we can generate a really good result for fine-tuning. We can use GPT to create a huge amount of training data by giving it prompts and examples, such as generating text-to-image prompts.</p>

<h2>Fine-Tuning the Model</h2>

<p>Once we have our data set, we can fine-tune the Falcon model using a platform like Google Colab. We need to install the necessary libraries, load the Falcon model, and tokenize it. Then, we can create a list of training arguments and run the trainer.train function to start the training process.</p>

<h2>Saving and Uploading the Model</h2>

<p>After fine-tuning the model, we can save it locally or upload it to Hugging Face. We can save it locally by using the model.save_pretrained function and upload it to Hugging Face by creating a new model under our profile and giving it a name and license.</p>

<h2>Running the Fine-Tuned Model</h2>

<p>Once we have uploaded the model, we can run it by creating a list of configuration for the model and then creating a prompt. We can then run the prompt and see the results, which should be a much better mid-journey prompt than the base model or ChatGPT.</p>

<p>This is how we can fine-tune a large-language model for mid-journey prompts. We can try out different use cases, such as customer support, legal documents, medical diagnosis, or financial advisories, and see the kind of models we can create.</p>
