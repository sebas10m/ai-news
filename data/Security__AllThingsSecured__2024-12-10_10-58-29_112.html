	<h1>ExpressVPN Review: Is it Trustworthy and Secure?</h1>
	<p>Welcome to All Things Secured. My name's Josh, and as a longtime user of ExpressVPN, I'm here to give you my two cents on the service.</p>
	<h2>Ease of Use</h2>
	<p>ExpressVPN has made significant strides in making their software accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. The power button, a feature they pioneered, makes connecting to the VPN a simple process.</p>
	<h2>Security and Trust</h2>
	<p>ExpressVPN's claim of not logging user data is supported by their track record, which includes withstanding a server seizure during the investigation of the Russian ambassador to Turkey's assassination.</p>
	<h2>Owners and Operation</h2>
	<p>ExpressVPN co-founder Peter Burkhart is a German-American entrepreneur who has worked for Microsoft in China and has a background in business. However, little information is publicly available about the company's ownership and operations.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>While ExpressVPN has made significant strides in making their software accessible and secure, the lack of transparency about their ownership and operations makes it difficult to fully trust the service.</p>
