<h1>Digital Biology: The Future of Scientific Discovery</h1>

<p>We may be entering a new era of digital biology, where artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, predicts that we are entering this era, and it will change the way we approach scientific discovery.</p>

<h2>What is Digital Biology?</h2>

<p>Digital biology can be thought of as a information processing system, albeit a complex and emergent one. AI may be the perfect description language for biology, allowing us to predict and understand biological processes in a way that was previously impossible.</p>

<h2>AlphaFold: A Game-Changer in Protein Folding</h2>

<p>AlphaFold is a AI-powered tool that uses machine learning to predict the 3D structure of proteins. This has been a 50-year-old problem, and AlphaFold has solved it with incredible accuracy. The tool has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, allowing us to predict how proteins fold and interact with each other.</p>

<h2>Classical Computing vs. Quantum Computing</h2>

<p>Classical computing is still a powerful tool, and we can do more with it than we previously thought. By using massive amounts of precompute and machine learning, we can efficiently explore solution spaces and model complex systems. Quantum computing will change the game, but classical computing will still be an important tool in many areas.</p>

<h2>The Future of Scientific Discovery</h2>

<p>The future of scientific discovery looks bright, with AI playing a crucial role. We may be able to simulate entire cells, rather than just individual proteins or molecules. We can accelerate drug discovery, making it faster and more accurate. The possibilities are endless, and it's an exciting time to be in the field of AI and scientific discovery.</p>
