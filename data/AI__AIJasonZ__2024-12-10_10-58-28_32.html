	<h1>Building a Large-Language Model Evaluation System</h1>
	<p>Building a large-language model system can be a time-consuming process, and one of the biggest challenges is evaluating its performance. In this article, we will discuss how to build a large-language model evaluation system to speed up the iteration process and increase the level of confidence for both you and your customers.</p>
	<h2>Choosing the Right Metrics</h2>
	<p>The first step in building a large-language model evaluation system is to choose the right metrics. This involves identifying the most important aspects of the system that you want to evaluate. For example, if you're building a RAC system, you may want to evaluate the retrieval accuracy and generation quality. On the other hand, if you're building a customer support system, you may want to evaluate the real-time UX and latency.</p>
	<h2>Designing Metrics</h2>
	<p>When designing metrics, you should consider the following factors: numeric metrics, binary or multi-output classification, and context-specific metrics. Numeric metrics can be useful for evaluating the precision and recall of the system, while binary or multi-output classification can be used to evaluate the correctness of the system's output. Context-specific metrics can be used to evaluate the system's performance in specific contexts or scenarios.</p>
	<h2>Building an Evaluator</h2>
	<p>The next step is to build an evaluator that can accurately evaluate the system's performance. This involves defining the inputs and outputs of the evaluator, as well as the metrics that it will use to evaluate the system. The evaluator can be a prompt template that takes in the system's output and generates an evaluation result.</p>
	<h2>Preparing a Golden Data Set</h3>
	<p>To ensure that the evaluator is working accurately, you need to prepare a golden data set that includes the correct evaluation results. This can be done manually or by using a logging system to collect user data. The golden data set can then be used to test and recalibrate the evaluator.</p>
	<h2>Tracking User Requests</h3>
	<p>To evaluate the system's performance in real-world scenarios, you need to track user requests and collect data on the system's output. This can be done using a logging system like Lensmith. Once the data is collected, you can create a dataset and use the evaluator to test the system's performance.</p>
	<h2>Creating Evaluators</h3>
	<p>You can create evaluators to test specific aspects of the system, such as data collection or generation quality. The evaluator can be used to generate a score based on the system's performance, which can be used to compare the performance of different models or versions of the system.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Building a large-language model evaluation system can be a complex process, but it is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the system. By choosing the right metrics, designing evaluators, and preparing golden data sets, you can create a system that accurately evaluates the performance of your large-language model system.</p>
