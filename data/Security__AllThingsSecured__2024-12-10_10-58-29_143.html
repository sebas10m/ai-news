<h1>Scam Emails: A Real-Life Example</h1>

<p>Scam emails come in all shapes and sizes. Recently, I received an email from a law firm claiming that I had used an image without proper credit, and they were threatening to take legal action unless I complied.</p>

<p>I took this email seriously, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions. Instead, I did some research to verify the legitimacy of the firm. I started by checking if the website they claimed to be associated with was safe to visit.</p>

<p>I visited <a href="https://nodilaw.com">nodilaw.com</a> and checked its safety status using Google Safe Browsing Site Status. Fortunately, the site was cleared as safe, which gave me a bit more trust in the legitimacy of the law firm.</p>

<p>However, my investigation didn't stop there. Upon visiting the website, I noticed that it looked suspiciously like a template website for a law firm. This raised another red flag. I then made a whois lookup of the domain to see who actually owned the website.</p>

<p>That's when I discovered that the website was hosted on a Chinese web host, which seemed unusual for a US law firm. Additionally, I found that the name servers were registered in China, which further fueled my suspicions.</p>

<p>I then decided to verify the physical location of the law firm. According to the website, the law firm was based at a specific address. But when I checked Google maps, I found that the address was a field, not a high-end neighborhood as I would expect for a law firm.</p>

<p>Based on these findings, I became convinced that the email was a scam. To test my suspicions, I emailed the sender back, pretending to be a clueless blogger. I asked her to advise me which images were in violation of her client's copyright.</p>

<p>She sent me the image, and I was able to verify that I had indeed purchased the rights to use it. I then asked her for more information about her client's demands. It turned out that she was asking for a credit link on my website, which I politely declined. She then demanded a payment of at least $5,000, which I couldn't afford.</p>

<p>Eventually, I called her out for being a scammer and asked her some questions. However, she stopped responding after that. The email address I had contacted her from no longer works. It's unclear what new scam she's working on now.</p>

<p>This experience shows that scam emails can be quite tricky and not all of them are trying to steal your sensitive information. This particular scam was trying to get me to add a link to a website for free. The takeaway is to always be vigilant and do your research before responding to any suspicious emails.</p>
