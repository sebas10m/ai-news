	<h1>Breakthroughs in Robotics AI</h1>
	<p>In the past few years, we've witnessed significant advancements in robotics AI, thanks to the development of transformers and large language models. One of the key breakthroughs is the launch of RT one, a paradigm-shifting method that uses transformer architecture to enable robots to understand and execute tasks in dynamic environments.</p>
	<p>Another significant breakthrough is the introduction of RT two, which combined a visual language model with RT one. This allowed robots to interpret complex commands and perform semantic reasoning, making them more adaptable and intelligent.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, the release of the open X embodiment data set, a collaborative effort among 20 institutions, has provided a massive robotic training data set, showcasing over 500 skills and 150,000 tasks across more than 1 million episodes. This has led to substantial improvements in robotic AI performance, with RT X outperforming RT two by 300% in emergent skill evaluation.</p>
	<p>Additionally, recent research has demonstrated the potential for large language models like GPT-4 to design reward functions for training robots, which could lead to significant advancements in real low-level dexterous skills like hand manipulation.</p>
	<p>Estimating a "ChAIBT" moment for robots, when they can seamlessly interact with their environment and complete tasks autonomously, is challenging. However, with the pace of development and industry deployment plans, it's not unlikely that we'll see robots achieving this milestone in the next 12 to 24 months.</p>
