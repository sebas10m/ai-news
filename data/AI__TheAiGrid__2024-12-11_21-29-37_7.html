    <h1>Google Gemini 2.0: A New Era of AI</h1>
    <p>Google has announced Gemini 2.0, a new AI model for the agentic era. This model enables new kinds of multimodal AI agents that can see and hear the world around them, think, plan, remember, and take action.</p>
    <h2 Project Astra: A Universal AI Assistant</h2>
    <p>Project Astra is a research prototype of a universal AI assistant that uses capabilities like multimodal memory and real-time information to understand the world live.</p>
    <h2>Project Mariner: A Research Prototype for Human-Agent Interaction</h2>
    <p>Project Mariner is a research prototype that explores the future of human-agent interaction and is built on Gemini 2.0. It allows users to interact with the web in a more efficient way and complete tasks on their behalf.</p>
    <h2>Gemini 2.0 Flash: A Fast and Powerful AI Model</h2>
    <p>Gemini 2.0 Flash is a fast and powerful AI model that can perform tasks like live streaming, spatial understanding, and native audio output. It can also be used for multimodal live API development.</p>
    <h2>Native Audio: A New Output Modality</h2>
    <p>Native audio is a new output modality in Gemini 2.0 that allows AI agents to speak in a more natural and expressive way. It can also switch languages seamlessly.</p>
    <h2>Building with Gemini 2.0</h2>
    <p>Gemini 2.0 is a platform that allows users to build their own multi-modal AI agents. It has a key tool use in the AI studio that makes it easier to explore spatial understanding with multimodal reasoning.</p>
    <h2>Jules: An AI-Powered Code Agent</h2>
    <p>Jules is an experimental AI-powered code agent that uses Gemini 2.0 to handle bugs and other time constraints. It can create comprehensive plans to address issues and prepare pull requests.</p>
    <h2>Olya: An AI Agent Built with Gemini 2.0</h2>
    <p>Olya is a full-length demo of an AI agent built with Gemini 2.0 that played the game Squadbusters. The agent's responses were based on the video and audio feed from the user.</p>
