    <h1>Advanced Prompt Engineers for Large Language Models</h1>
    <p>Getting the prompt right is hard, especially if you want to deliver consistent results at scale. But what if you can control the prompt to get specific output structure and general image and charts with just one single prompt?</p>
    <h2>Guidance Framework</h2>
    <p>The first framework I want to talk about is called Guidance. It is an open-source framework initially introduced by Microsoft and has more than 12,000 stars on GitHub. Fundamentally, it is a framework that allows you to program the prompt to get specific output.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Define a specific output structure you want.</li>
        <li>Restrict the actual output that Large Language Model generates.</li>
        <li>Set up advanced logic like if conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Using Guidance for Advanced Prompt Engineering</h2>
    <p>With the Guidance framework, you can achieve complex tasks like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Restricting the output of Large Language Model to predefined answers.</li>
        <li>Setting up advanced logic like if conditions.</li>
        <li>Generating real-time charts and images.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other Communities and Open Source Projects</h2>
    <p>While the Guidance framework is powerful, it still has limitations. To speed up the process, I recommend exploring other communities and open-source projects, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>FlowGPT: a prompt library and community.</li>
        <li>Prompts Royal: a front-end based on GPT prompt engineer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These resources can help you discover better starting points for your prompts and evaluate different variants of prompts to get the best results.</p>
