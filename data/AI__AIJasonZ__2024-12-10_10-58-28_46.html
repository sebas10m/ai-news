    <h1>Building an AI Research Agent</h1>
    <p>In this article, we will explore the process of building an AI research agent using OpenAI and Python. The agent will be designed to research topics and provide relevant information through a web service.</p>
    <h2>Designing the Research Agent</h2>
    <p>The research agent will consist of three main components: a search tool, a website scraping tool, and a summarization tool. The search tool will use the OpenAI API to search for relevant information on a given topic. The website scraping tool will use a service like Browserless to extract content from relevant websites. The summarization tool will use a summarization algorithm to summarize the extracted content.</p>
    <h2>Implementing the Search Tool</h2>
    <p>The search tool will be implemented using the OpenAI API. The API will be used to search for relevant information on a given topic. The search results will be returned in a JSON format and will contain links to relevant websites.</p>
    <h2>Implementing the Website Scraping Tool</h2>
    <p>The website scraping tool will be implemented using a service like Browserless. The tool will extract content from relevant websites and return it in a JSON format.</p>
    <h2>Implementing the Summarization Tool</h2>
    <p>The summarization tool will be implemented using a summarization algorithm. The algorithm will take the extracted content and summarize it into a shorter format.</p>
    <h2>Creating the Research Agent</h2>
    <p>The research agent will be created by combining the search, website scraping, and summarization tools. The agent will be designed to take in a topic and return relevant information through a web service.</p>
    <h2>Testing the Research Agent</h2>
    <p>The research agent will be tested using a testing framework. The testing framework will simulate user input and verify the output of the agent.</p>
    <h2>Deploying the Research Agent</h2>
    <p>The research agent will be deployed on a cloud platform. The platform will provide the necessary resources and infrastructure for the agent to run.</p>
    <h2>Integrating the Research Agent with Make.com</h2>
    <p>The research agent will be integrated with Make.com, a no-code automation platform. The platform will allow users to trigger the research agent through APIs and automate workflows.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In this article, we explored the process of building an AI research agent using OpenAI and Python. The agent was designed to research topics and provide relevant information through a web service. The agent was implemented using a search tool, a website scraping tool, and a summarization tool. The agent was tested using a testing framework and deployed on a cloud platform. The agent was also integrated with Make.com, a no-code automation platform.</p>
