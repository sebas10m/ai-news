	<h1>Building an Inbox Manager AI Agent</h1>
	<p>The goal of this project was to build an AI agent that can manage my email inbox efficiently. I started by using a simple AI agent that could create email drafts for me, but I soon realized that I needed a more sophisticated agent that could learn and adapt to my behavior.</p>
	<h2>Creating a Knowledge Base</h2>
	<p>To create a knowledge base for the AI agent, I used my past emails to extract facts and knowledge about myself. I wrote a Python script to parse the emails and create a CSV file with two columns: the original message and the reply.</p>
	<h2>Extracting Facts and FAQ</h2>
	<p>Next, I used the TSV file to extract facts and FAQ about myself. I wrote another Python script to load the CSV file, extract the data, and save it as a new CSV file.</p>
	<h2>Creating a Knowledge Retrieval System</h2>
	<p>I created a knowledge retrieval system using the Landchain and Llama index platforms. However, I soon realized that I needed a more flexible system that could handle multiple types of emails and responses.</p>
	<h2>Integrating with Relevance AI</h2>
	<p>I integrated the AI agent with Relevance AI, which provided a platform to manage and update the knowledge base. I created a new knowledge retrieval tool called "Email Drafter V2" that used the Relevance AI platform to generate high-quality email responses.</p>
	<h2>Categorizing Emails and Defining Next Steps</h2>
	<p>I defined a simple system prompt to give the AI agent a role and goal. I then created a list of custom tools that the agent could use to categorize emails and define next steps. The tools included categorize email, research, reply email, and create email draft.</p>
	<h2>Deploying the AI Agent</h2>
	<p>I deployed the AI agent on the cloud service Render.com and used it as a webhook to be called when new emails were received. I also integrated the agent with Zapier, Make.com, and NAN.</p>
	<h2>Future Developments</h2>
	<p>I plan to continue developing the AI agent, including automating schedule meetings and adding more features to the knowledge retrieval system.</p>
	<p>This project taught me the importance of iterating and refining my ideas to create a sophisticated AI agent that can manage my email inbox efficiently.</p>
