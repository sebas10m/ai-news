<h1>7 Important Security Tips You May Not Be Doing</h1>
<p>As an individual, it's essential to be aware of various security measures to protect yourself online. In this article, we'll discuss seven crucial security tips that can help you safeguard your sensitive information.</p>

<h2>Tip 1: Set Up a Separate Email Address for Sensitive Logins</h2>
<p>One of the first security measures is to create a separate email address for your banking, investments, and other highly sensitive online logins.</p>
<p>This way, even if you receive a phishing campaign or scam email to your primary email address, you can easily identify it as a fake and avoid falling victim to it.</p>

<h2>Tip 2: Use Virtual Credit Cards for Online Transactions</h2>
<p>When making online purchases, it's recommended to use virtual credit cards instead of sharing your actual credit card information.</p>
<p>This way, even if an online merchant is compromised, your actual credit card information remains safe and secure.</p>

<h2>Tip 3: Set Up a Credit Freeze to Secure Your Credit Information</h2>
<p>Setting up a credit freeze can help prevent identity theft and protect your credit information from being accessed without your permission.</p>
<p>This is especially crucial in today's digital age where data breaches and identity theft are becoming increasingly common.</p>

<h2>Tip 4: Remove Your Personal Information from Data Brokers</h2>
<p>Data brokers collect and sell your personal information, including your name, email address, and location data.</p>
<p>By removing your information from these brokers, you can reduce the risk of identity theft and protect your personal data.</p>

<h2>Tip 5: Tether to Mobile Data Instead of Public Wi-Fi</h2>
<p>When in public, it's recommended to tether to your mobile data instead of connecting to public Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>This way, you can maintain a stronger connection and reduce the risk of being hacked or compromised.</p>

<h2>Tip 6: Turn Off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth When Not in Use</h2>
<p>It's essential to turn off your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not in use to prevent potential threats and hack attempts.</p>
<p>By doing so, you can reduce the risk of your device being compromised and minimize the risk of data breaches.</p>

<h2>Tip 7: Enable Stolen Device Protection and Face ID</h2>
<p>Enabling stolen device protection and Face ID can help prevent data breaches and protect your sensitive information.</p>
<p>By doing so, you can minimize the risk of your device being compromised and ensure that your data remains safe and secure.</p>

<p>By following these security tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and protect your sensitive information.</p>
<p>Remember, security is an ongoing process, and it's essential to stay vigilant and take proactive measures to protect yourself online.</p>
