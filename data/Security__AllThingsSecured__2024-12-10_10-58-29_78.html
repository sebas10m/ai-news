<h1>Welcome to All Things Secured</h1>

<p>My name is Josh and I'd like to begin by discussing the importance of securing your iPhone. With the constant use of our devices, it's essential to make critical changes to protect our personal data.</p>

<h2>1. Secure Your iPhone Passcode</h2>

<p>Set a numeric passcode that's at least six digits long, or consider an alphanumeric phrase for added security. To change your passcode, go into your Settings app, scroll down to Face ID and Passcode, and click on Change Passcode.</p>

<h2>2. Limit Lock Screen Permissions</h2>

<p>Ensure that your lock screen doesn't pose a security risk by restricting access to features like Control Center while your phone is locked.</p>

<h2>3. Review Location and Bluetooth Permissions</h2>

<p>Audit your location and Bluetooth permissions, and revoke access to unnecessary apps. This will help prevent unauthorized tracking and data sharing.</p>

<h2>4. Implement a Password Manager</h2>

<p>Use a password manager to securely store and retrieve high-quality passwords. Trend Micro's Premium Security Suite includes a password manager that syncs across all devices.</p>

<h2>5. Reconsider the Facebook App</h2>

<p>Consider deleting or using the Facebook app less frequently, as it can be a significant tracker of your location and activities.</p>

<h2>6. Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h2>

<p>Secure your iCloud account and stored data by enabling two-factor authentication. This adds an extra layer of security to your iPhone's login process.</p>

<h2>7. Remove EXIF Data from Photos</h2>

<p>When sharing photos, consider turning off or removing GPS data to prevent others from determining your exact location.</p>

<h2>8. Secure Your Kids' Devices</h2>

<p>Make changes to your kids' devices to control their access to the internet, apps, and other sensitive information. Consider using a family-friendly app like Trend Micro's Family app.</p>

<p>This concludes our video on securing your iPhone. Always remember to stay vigilant and update your security settings regularly to protect your personal data.</p>
