<h1>Four Levels of Personal Data Encryption</h1>

<p>We tend to judge tech companies by how well they encrypt and handle our data, and as well we should. But what about you? How well do you protect your own data?</p>

<h2>Level 1: Full Disk Encryption</h2>

<p>Before you consider encrypting files in the cloud or files that you're sending to other people, step one is to simply protect the data that you keep on your physical devices, known as full disk encryption.</p>

<p>On a Mac computer, turn on FileVault, which can be found in your system settings, and on a Windows computer, open your settings, choose privacy and security, and then find device encryption.</p>

<h2>Level 2: Protecting Cloud Data</h2>

<p>The next level of personal data encryption means protecting the stuff that you upload to the cloud. Most people don't realize that services like Google Drive or Dropbox aren't end-to-end encrypted.</p>

<p>To protect your cloud data, use end-to-end encryption, such as services like ProtonDrop, NordLocker, Sync.com, which offer this kind of data encryption.</p>

<h2>Level 3: Integration with Existing Services</h2>

<p>The next level of personal data protection is about encryption solutions that integrate with what you're already using.</p>

<p>For example, Apple's Advanced Data Protection ensures that almost all of the data you upload to Apple's iCloud servers is fully encrypted.</p>

<p>For Google Drive and Dropbox, use solutions like double encryption with Boxcryptor or Cryptomator, or a service like OrangeDocs, which offers granular control over who can access your files.</p>

<h2>Level 4: Selective Encryption</h2>

<p>The final level of data encryption boils down to control. With a service like confidential.io, you can selectively choose which parts of a file are encrypted, including entire pages of a document, one particular section, or even a specific word or phrase throughout the document.</p>

<p>This provides the best of all the previous levels combined: end-to-end encryption, the ability to store files anywhere you want with confidence, and the ability to control not just who can see the file, but also which parts of the file can be seen.</p>

<h3>Additional Tips</h3>

<p>Encrypt external hard drives or thumb drives with proprietary software or third-party apps like VeriCrypt.</p>

<p>For professional editions of Microsoft Windows, use the native BitLocker tool, and for home users, try a third-party app like VeriCrypt.</p>
