<h1>Setting Up a VPN on Your iPhone</h1>

<p>There are three primary ways to set up a VPN on your iPhone: manually, through an app, and through a browser.</p>

<h2>Manual Configuration</h2>

<p>If you've been given a VPN setup, navigate to the Settings app, find the VPN on the left side, and click on the add VPN configuration button.</p>

<p>You'll need to enter the server, remote ID, username, and password provided by your employer or VPN service.</p>

<p>Once you've entered the information, click done, and the VPN configuration will be saved in the VPN tab.</p>

<h2>Setting Up a VPN through an App</h2>

<p>You can also set up a VPN using a VPN app, such as NordVPN.</p>

<p>Download the app from the App Store, sign up on your computer, and log in to the app on your phone.</p>

<p>The app will ask for permission to set up a VPN configuration, which will automatically configure the VPN for you.</p>

<p>To connect to the VPN, choose a server from the list and click on it.</p>

<h2>Setting Up a VPN through a Browser</h2>

<p>You can also set up a VPN through a browser, such as the Tor browser.</p>

<p>Download and install the Tor browser, and open it on your phone.</p>

<p>The Tor browser will allow you to connect to a VPN server in one of many countries, anonymizing and encrypting your connection.</p>
