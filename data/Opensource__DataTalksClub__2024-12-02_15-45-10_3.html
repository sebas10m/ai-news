	<h1>Machine Learning Healthcare</h1>
	<p>Machine learning healthcare is a specific aspect of machine learning that involves building predictive models to improve healthcare outcomes.</p>
	<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
	<p>The problem is that hospitalization costs are difficult to predict, and patients often receive unexpected bills. This can lead to a loss of trust between patients and hospitals.</p>
	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>The solution is to build a cost prediction system that takes into account various factors, including patient demographics, medical history, and hospital procedures.</p>
	<h2>Architecture</h2>
	<p>The architecture of the system involves data preparation, feature engineering, machine learning, and deployment.</p>
	<h2>Data Preparation</h2>
	<p>Data preparation involves cleaning and processing the data, including missing value imputation, normalization, and encoding.</p>
	<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
	<p>Machine learning involves building predictive models using various algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.</p>
	<h2>Deployment</h2>
	<p>Deployment involves integrating the machine learning model into a hospital's existing system, allowing for real-time cost estimates.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The results show a significant reduction in error rates, improved query latency, and increased customization options for hospitals.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.</p>
