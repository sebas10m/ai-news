    <h1>Create Your Own Auto GPT App with Relevance AI</h1>
    <p>Relevance AI is a no-code platform that allows you to build powerful auto GPT apps.</p>
    <h2>Building an Auto GPT App with Relevance AI</h2>
    <p>To create an auto GPT app that can write a code outreach email to Mark Cuban for Andrew investing, you can follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Search for Mark Cuban's latest news using a search engine like Google.</p></li>
        <li><p>Extract the news list from the search results using a JS code transformation.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pass the news list to GPT and ask it to choose the best news that can help understand Mark Cuban's perspective and thesis about AI.</p></li>
        <li><p>Script the data from the chosen news article using a make API request and the BrowserList service.</p></li>
        <li><p>Extract the text from the news article using a JS code transformation.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pass the news content to GPT and ask it to summarize the article for you.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pass the summary of the news to GPT and ask it to write an outreach email for you.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Example Code Outreach Email</h2>
    <p>Here is an example of a code outreach email that the GPT app can write:</p>
    <p>Dear Mark Cuban,</p>
    <p>I recently came across your thoughts on AI chatbots and their potential impact on the job market. Your insights on the importance of ethical considerations in the development of AI resonate with me.</p>
    <p>I'm reaching out to discuss a potential angel investment opportunity for my AI startup, Jasper. We're a team of experts in the field, and we believe our technology has the potential to make a significant impact.</p>
    <p>Would you be open to hearing more about our proposal and discussing the possibility of collaboration?</p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>[Your Name]</p>
