<h1>Email Phishing Scams: How to Protect Yourself</h1>

<p>Email phishing scams have become more sophisticated and can be easily mistaken for legitimate emails. To protect yourself, you need to be critical of the emails you receive and ask yourself four questions:</p>

<h2>The STOP Method</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>S:</b> Is this email suspicious? Look for red flags such as misspelled words, improper use of grammar, or an impersonal closing.</li>
    <li><b>T:</b> Is this email telling me to click a link or a button? Be cautious of emails that ask you to click on a link or button, especially if it's a request for sensitive information.</li>
    <li><b>O:</b> Is this email offering something that's too good to be true? If an email is offering a deal that seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
    <li><b>P:</b> Is this email pushing me to do something immediately or quickly? Be wary of emails that create a sense of urgency, such as requiring immediate action or threatening consequences if you don't respond.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're unsure about an email, find a different method to confirm its authenticity. For example, you can:</p>

<h2>Confirming Authenticity</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Call or text the sender to verify the email's legitimacy.</li>
    <li>Use a different method of communication, such as a phone call or in-person conversation, to confirm the email's authenticity.</li>
    <li>Verify the email's contents by accessing the sender's website or contacting their customer service directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, these four simple questions can help you identify potential phishing scams and protect yourself from falling victim to them. Stay vigilant and critical of the emails you receive, and you'll be better equipped to defend yourself against email phishing scams.</p>
