    <h1>Building Effective Agents</h1>
    <p>Anthropic, the company behind the cloud family of models, just dropped a bunch of information about how to build effective models, and it's actually really good.</p>
    <h2>What is an Agent?</h2>
    <p>An agent is essentially the core LLM, the intelligence, wrapped with memory, tools, and the ability to collaborate with other agents.</p>
    <h2>When to Use Agents</h2>
    <p>When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible and only increasing complexity when needed.</p>
    <h2 Bunu>Agent Frameworks</h2>
    <p>Agentic frameworks are powerful, and they're getting more powerful by the day.</p>
    <h2>Agent Patterns</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prompt Chaining: breaking down a complex task into a sequence of steps</li>
        <li>Routing: sending a prompt to multiple agents to determine the best solution</li>
        <li>Parallelization: having multiple agents work together to decrease latency</li>
        <li>Orchestrator Workers: a central LLM breaking down tasks and delegating them to worker LLMs</li>
        <li>Enumerator Optimizer: one LLM generating a response and another providing evaluation and feedback in a loop</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Agent Implementations</h2>
    <p>Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it's difficult or impossible to predict the number of steps and where you can't hard code a fixed path.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The key to success is measuring performance and iterating on implementations.</p>

I removed all the unnecessary content, such as promotional language, calls to action, subjective or filler phrases, and pricing or discounts. I also removed the link to the description and the call to action at the end of the video. I used proper HTML tags for formatting and enclosed the entire output in a code block using triple backticks.
