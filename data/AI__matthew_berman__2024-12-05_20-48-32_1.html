    <h1>AI Update</h1>
    <p>Google DeepMind has released Genie 2, a fully playable video game with no underlying game engine, capable of generating an endless variety of action-controllable playable 3D environments.</p>
    <p>genie 2 is a large-scale foundation world model that can generate a 3D world from a single prompt image.</p>
    <p>The model can remember parts of the world that are no longer in view and render them accurately when they become observable again.</p>
    <p>World Labs has also released a new update on world modeling, allowing users to generate 3D worlds from a single image.</p>
    <p>The model is open-source and can be interacted with directly, allowing users to change lighting, add spotlights, and navigate the scene in real-time.</p>
    <p>11 Labs has released conversational AI agents that can speak in minutes with low latency, full configurability, and seamless scalability.</p>
    <p>The model can understand and respond to user input in a natural way, and is available in 32 languages.</p>
    <p>11 Labs has also released a version of Google's Notebook LM product, allowing users to create smart personal podcasts from any text-based content.</p>
    <p>Tencent has released an open-source text-to-video model called HunYuan, which can generate high-quality video clips from text prompts.</p>
    <p>Prime Intellect has released Intellect One, an open-source decentralized trained 10B model, which can be trained on a network of smaller machines.</p>
    <p>Anthropic has released the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives.</p>
    <p>Runway has released a new image generation model called Frames, which can establish a specific look for a project and reliably generate variations that stay true to the aesthetic.</p>
    <p>AWS has released Amazon Nova, a new LLM that can process 300k input tokens and is available in Amazon Bedrock.</p>
    <p>Anthropic has also announced a new $4 billion investment from Amazon, which will be used to develop future generations of Tranium chips.</p>
    <p>Anthropic is working with AWS to optimize every aspect of Frontier model training, including hardware and software design.</p>
