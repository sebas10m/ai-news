<h1>The Biggest Mistakes I Made in My Journey to a Six-Figure Tech Job</h1>

<p>As I reflect on my journey from graduating high school to landing a six-figure tech job, I can identify several critical mistakes that held me back. These errors, if rectified earlier, could have significantly accelerated my progress and success.</p>

<h2>Mistake #1: Procrastination and Lack of Planning</h2>

<p>After high school, I took 18 months off to "figure myself out." However, I spent this time lacking a clear plan, as I did not research my future, set clear goals, or seek guidance. This period was marked by a lack of motivation and direction.</p>

<h2>Mistake #2: Focusing on the Wrong Questions</h2>

<p>My initial goal was to find a lucrative six-figure job, but I failed to understand the underlying reasons why such jobs exist. I should have focused on the "how" and "why" instead of only the "what." Had I done so, I would have developed a better understanding of the expertise required for success in my chosen field.</p>

<h2>Mistake #3: Assuming College Was Enough</h2>

<p>I believed that obtaining a degree in computer science would automatically lead to a high-paying job. However, I underestimated the importance of relevant work experience, specializations, and continuous learning. My lack of research and understanding of the job market led to disappointment and frustration.</p>

<h2>Mistake #4: Not Pursuing My Interests Properly</h2>

<p>I was initially drawn to computer science and coding, but I failed to develop a genuine passion for it. I found myself stuck in college, procrastinating, and playing video games instead of focusing on my studies. This diversion led me down the wrong path, and I later discovered that cybersecurity might not be the right fit for me.</p>

<h2>Mistake #5: Not Getting an IT Job Sooner</h2>

<p>I failed to take advantage of entry-level opportunities in IT, such as help desk positions, which could have provided valuable experience and opened doors to further career advancement. This decision delayed my entry into the field and prolonged my period of uncertainty.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>These regrets serve as a cautionary tale for anyone embarking on a career in tech. Investing time in research, planning, and continuous learning can significantly impact one's trajectory. Networking, building projects, and collecting certifications can provide a substantial edge in the job market.</p>
