	<h1>SmallAI: A Revolutionary AI Project</h1>
	<p>Every once in a while, there's a project that made me feel we're just scraping the surface with generative AI. And SmallAI is definitely one of those projects. It got more than 8,000 stars on GitHub in just five days, and it is one of the fastest growing open source AI projects.</p>
	<h2>What is SmallAI?</h2>
	<p>SmallAI is an AI that writes codes for you. And it's different from asking ChatGPT to write some simple code snippet. It actually builds out an entire code base for even very complicated apps.</p>
	<h3>An Example</h3>
	<p>Here's a quick example. I asked GPT-4 to write a product requirement doc for a classic snake game, and then pass on those requirements to the SmallAI. And asked it to build this app. And boom, I just got this snake game that is fully functional from SmallAI.</p>
	<h2>How Does SmallAI Work?</h2>
	<p>When you're looking through their code base, it's actually very straightforward. First, they pass the product requirement into a prompt. They will generate the architecture of the apps, what are the different files we need to create. And then it will pass this list of files. As well as original code.</p>
	<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
	<p>One tip I want to share is that if you want to use SmallAI to generate code, it's recommended to write a clear and specific product requirement. This will help SmallAI to generate code that meets your needs.</p>
	<h3>Debugging</h3>
	<p>SmallAI also provides a way to debug the code. If you add any arrows when running the code, you can create a debug file and run it with the model. This will give you analysis of the potential arrows and how to fix them.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>SmallAI is a revolutionary AI project that has the potential to change the way we develop software. While it's still a little bit buggy and not capable to produce very complicated apps out of box yet, I'm excited about its possibilities and look forward to seeing its development in the future.</p>
