<h1>AI Generated Influencer</h1>
<p>In recent years, AI generated influencers have become a significant topic of discussion. Companies have emerged, specializing in creating AI Instagram models that resemble human beings and post their lives online. However, instead of a real person, these models are often controlled by a male profit engineer.</p>
<p>Despite the artificial nature of these influencers, they have gained a significant following on social media platforms like Twitter, with some having over 100,000 followers. This raises the question of what actual business value or use cases exist for AI generated models.</p>
<p>One entrepreneur was looking to utilize AI generated models to improve his online clothing business in China. He aimed to create 20-30 social media posts per day featuring people wearing his clothes. He explained that this was necessary to increase customer confidence in his products.</p>
<p>After exploring the concept further, it became apparent that AI powered fashion and clothing models could be highly valuable. They could help customers visualize how products would look on them, and e-commerce sites could generate a large amount of product images for different types of customers.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I built an image generation agent that could mix and match different faces, clothes, and environments to create social media posts for fashion. The process involves using a diffusion model, which breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.</p>
<p>However, as the entrepreneur in China discovered, creating a high-fidelity image requires a lot of training data. To address this, I looked into alternative methods, including the use of IPAdapter, a lightweight solution for inserting elements into an image generation model. This method doesn't require a large amount of training data and can encode an image or text prompt and mix them together as a final prompt for the image generation model.</p>
<p>By combining IPAdapter with a stable diffusion model, I was able to create a custom AI model that could generate high-quality, photorealistic images of people wearing specific clothes in different environments.</p>
<p>In this example, I've demonstrated how to use Confi UI to create a workflow for generating an AI model face, adding clothes, and fine-tuning the image to achieve a desired result. I've also explored the use of IPAdapter to insert elements into the image generation model and fine-tuned a stable diffusion model to generate photorealistic images.</p>
<p>Finally, I've shown how to deploy the Confi AI workflow on a hosted platform like Replicate, where it can be used to generate high-quality images for a variety of applications.</p>
<p>Please note that this is just a basic example, and there are many ways to customize and improve the image generation pipeline. I hope this example helps you understand how AI powered fashion and clothing models can be used to improve online shopping experiences.</p>
