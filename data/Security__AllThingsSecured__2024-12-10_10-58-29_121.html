    <h1>Protecting Your Privacy on Facebook</h1>
    <p>When you download your Facebook file, you may be shocked at the amount of data that Facebook has collected about you. But did you know that Facebook doesn't just collect data from your activity on the platform? They also collect data from your searches, likes, comments, and even your location. In fact, they estimate that they can track around 52,000 traits about you.</p>
    <h2>Data Collection on Facebook</h2>
    <p>There are four primary kinds of data that Facebook tracks about you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit data: the data that you voluntarily give to Facebook when you sign up or upload a photo</li>
      <li_Metadata_: the data that is embedded in your posts and photos, such as EXIF data</li>
      <li>Off Facebook activity: the data that Facebook collects about you when you visit other websites or use Facebook features like the Facebook pixel</li>
      <li>Third-party data: the data that advertisers upload to Facebook, such as your purchase history and other personal details</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Protecting Your Data on Facebook</h2>
    <p>While it's impossible to completely eliminate Facebook's data collection, there are steps you can take to limit what data they collect and restrict what they can do with it. Here are six things you can do today to improve your privacy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Delete the Facebook app on your phone and tablet, and use a browser like Brave or Firefox instead</li>
      <li>Use an internet browser with a Facebook container extension to limit Facebook's ability to track your activity</li>
      <li>Jump onto your Facebook account and manage your off Facebook activity to limit Facebook's ability to track your activity when you're not on the platform</li>
      <li.Make your public profile more private by limiting who can see your information and controlling what appears in your public profile</li>
      <li>Be more careful about how you upload your photos, and consider stripping EXIF data before uploading</li>
      <li>Be stingy about the information you voluntarily give to Facebook, such as checking in to locations or tagging your photos</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By taking these steps, you can reduce the amount of data that Facebook collects and limits the ways in which they can use that data. Remember, your data is precious, and it's up to you to protect it.</p>
