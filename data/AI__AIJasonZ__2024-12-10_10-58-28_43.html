	<h1>Web Scraping with Large Language Models</h1>
	<p>In this article, we will explore the use of large language models for web scraping, specifically for extracting data from public and simple websites.</p>
	<h2>Public and Simple Websites</h2>
	<p>Large language models can extract structured information from raw HTML, making it easier to scrape data from public and simple websites. We can utilize tools like FileCore, Jina, and SpiderCloud to optimize web content for large language models.</p>
	<h3>FileCore, Jina, and SpiderCloud</h3>
	<p>FileCore, Jina, and SpiderCloud are services that provide large language model optimized web content, making it easier to scrape data from websites. We can use these services to build a web scraper agent that can extract data from a website and save it to a JSON file.</p>
	<h2>Complex Websites</h2>
	<p>For complex websites that require authentication or have complex web interactions, we can use tools like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright to simulate web browser interactions.</p>
	<h3>AgentQL</h3>
	<p>AgentQL is a tool that can identify the right UI elements to interact with, making it easier to build a web scraper agent that can log in to a website and extract data.</p>
	<h4>Login Function</h4>
	<p>We can use the AgentQL plugin to locate UI elements and interact with the login form. We can also use the AgentQL API to extract data from the website.</p>
	<h4>Job Posting Data</h4>
	<p>Once we have logged in to the website, we can use the AgentQL API to extract job posting data and save it to Airtable or Google Sheets.</p>
	<h2>Future Directions</h2>
	<p>The field of web scraping is rapidly evolving, and we can expect to see more advanced tools and techniques in the future. For example, Multion is a company that is building fully autonomous web agents that can complete complex workflows.</p>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>In conclusion, large language models have made web scraping easier and more efficient. We can use tools like FileCore, Jina, and SpiderCloud to optimize web content for large language models, and tools like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright to simulate web browser interactions. AgentQL is a powerful tool that can help us build web scraper agents that can log in to websites and extract data. As the field of web scraping continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced tools and techniques emerge.</p>
