<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
This article will walk you through the process of recreating the Gemini demo using GPT-4V, Whisper, and a text-to-speech model.

<h2 id="setup">Setting Up the Next.js Project</h2>
To set up the Next.js project, we will use the `npx create-next-app` command. We will also install the required packages, including the GPT-4V SDK, Whisper, and text-to-speech model.

<h2 id="chatbx">Creating the Chat Button</h2>
We will create a new file called `chat.jsx` and import the required libraries, including React and the GPT-4V SDK. We will then define the UI elements and functionality for the chat button.

<h2 id="audio">Adding Audio Recorder with Silence Aware Recorder</h2>
We will use the Silence Aware Recorder library to detect when the user stops speaking. We will also create a new function called `unspeech` to handle the audio recording.

<h2 id="image-grid">Generating Image Grid and Uploading to Free Image Hosting Service</h2>
We will create a new function called `getImageDimensions` to get the dimensions of the image. We will then create a new function called `base64ToBlob` to convert the image data to a blob. We will also create a new function called `uploadImageToFreeImageHost` to upload the image to a free image hosting service.

<h2 id="speech-to-text">Transcribing Audio to Text with Whisper</h2>
We will create a new API endpoint called `speech-to-text` to handle the transcription of audio to text. We will use the Whisper model to perform the transcription.

<h2 id="api-key">Storing API Key and Language Locally</h2>
We will create a new library called `useLocalStorage` to store the API key and language locally.

<h2 id="gpt4b-response">Sending Prompt to GPT-4B and Displaying Response</h2>
We will use the GPT-4V SDK to send a prompt to GPT-4B and display the response.

<h2 id="text-to-speech">Converting Text Response to Audio with Text-to-Speech Model</h2>
We will create a new API endpoint called `text-to-speech` to handle the conversion of text response to audio.

<h2 id="demo">Testing the Demo</h2>
We will test the demo by creating a new instance of the chat application and sending a prompt to GPT-4B.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
This article has walked you through the process of recreating the Gemini demo using GPT-4V, Whisper, and a text-to-speech model. We have covered the setup of the Next.js project, creating the chat button, adding audio recorder with Silence Aware Recorder, generating image grid and uploading to free image hosting service, transcribing audio to text with Whisper, storing API key and language locally, sending prompt to GPT-4B and displaying response, and converting text response to audio with text-to-speech model.
