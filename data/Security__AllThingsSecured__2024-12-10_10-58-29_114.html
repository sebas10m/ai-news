<h1>Getting to Know Facebook Protect</h1>

<p>I recently received an email from Facebook about Facebook Protect, a program designed to help individuals with a large audience on the platform protect themselves from hackers or social engineering campaigns.</p>

<p>The email had a sense of urgency, asking me to turn on Facebook Protect by April 23rd, or risk being locked out of my account. However, a red flag for me is when an email urges me to do something fast, a common tactic used in scams.</p>

<p>I decided to go into my Facebook account to verify the email. Surprisingly, I was locked out of all my settings and security options. This led me to investigate Facebook's help files, where I found out that Facebook Protect emails are sent from a legitimate Facebook address, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mail">Facebookmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>After verifying the email's legitimacy, I clicked on the button, expecting to be asked to take additional security measures. However, Facebook only double-checked my existing account settings, which I already had in place, including a strong password and two-factor authentication.</p>

<p>This experience felt like a charade, and I'm not the only one who thinks so. Facebook Protect seems to be an invitation-only program, which makes it feel less special than Google's Advanced Protection Program.</p>

<p>So, what can you take away from this experience? If you haven't received an invitation to Facebook Protect, you don't have to worry. The most important thing is to ensure you have a strong password and two-factor authentication set up on your account, with a backup option in case you lose access to your primary method.</p>
