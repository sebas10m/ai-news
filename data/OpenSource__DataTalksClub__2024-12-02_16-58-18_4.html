    <h1>Nixie Search: An Open Source Search Engine</h1>
    <p>Nixie Search is a search engine built on Apache Lucene, with a novel approach to indexing and querying. It uses a block storage index in S3, allowing for highly available and scalable search functionality.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Native language support</li>
        <li>Facets and filters</li>
        <li>Query completion and suggestions</li>
        <li>Semantic search using embedding models</li>
        <li>Query generation model for fine-tuning</li>
        <li> Robust and well-tested codebase</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved search results and relevance</li>
        <li>High availability and scalability</li>
        <li>Easy to use and maintain</li>
        <li>Fine-tuning and customization options</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>Nixie Search is built using a combination of Apache Lucene, Apache Kafka, and Docker. It uses a block storage index in S3 for efficient querying and indexing.</p>
    <h2>Demo and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Roman has demonstrated the search functionality of Nixie Search using a movie lens dataset. The demo showcases the search engine's ability to perform facets, aggregations, filtering, and autocomplete.</p>
    <h2>Comparison to MetaRank</h2>
    <p>Nixie Search is a more comprehensive search engine compared to MetaRank, which is a learned ranker for secondary ranking. While MetaRank focuses on solving the problem of broken relevancy, Nixie Search provides a proper search engine with fine-tuning options.</p>
    <h2>Advice for Implementers</h2>
    <p>Roman advises developers to start with the basics of information retrieval, focusing on BM25 and lexical retrieval, which are strong baselines in production. He also emphasizes the importance of proper search engine design and not relying on hype or overambitious technologies.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Nixie Search is an open-source search engine built on top of Apache Lucene, with a novel approach to indexing and querying. Its key features, benefits, and technical details make it an attractive choice for developers looking to build a robust and scalable search functionality.</p>
