<h1>Why You're Probably Doing 2FA Wrong and How to Avoid It</h1>
<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a crucial security measure that can prevent unauthorized access to your online accounts. However, many people make common mistakes that completely negate its security benefits.</p>

<h2>The Number One Mistake: Receiving 2FA Codes via SMS Text</h2>
<p>Receiving 2FA codes via SMS text is a weak link in your security chain due to the risk of SIM swapping attacks. This occurred to Jack Dorsey, then CEO of Twitter, in 2019, and can happen to anyone. Consider using alternative 2FA methods, such as authenticator apps or 2FA security keys.</p>

<h2>Not Enabling 2FA Across Most Accounts</h2>
<p>Not securing most online accounts with 2FA is a mistake. If an online account offers 2FA as an available security setting, take advantage of it. This includes using a 2FA key on a keychain and storing authenticator codes in a password manager.</p>

<h2>Failing to Set Up Proper Backup</h2>
<p>Proper backup is essential to prevent loss of access to online accounts and assets. A good backup meets three criteria: it is a separate device kept in a separate location that is equally secure. Consider using a 2FA security key as a backup, stored securely away from your primary device.</p>

<h2>The Future of Identity Verification</h2>
<p>Identity verification is evolving, and you may already be using it without realizing. Biometrics, such as facial recognition and fingerprints, offer a secure option that's difficult to forge and can replace passwords and 2FA in some cases.</p>
