  <h1>Arrival in Sydney</h1>
  <p>After a long journey, I finally made it to the airport at 5am. I was not looking forward to eating an overpriced breakfast, but a burnt ham and cheese croissant was all that was available.</p>
  <p>Due to a train strike, I decided to take an Uber from the airport to my hotel. The ride was uneventful, and I was looking forward to eating a proper meal soon.</p>
  <p>My hotel room was a standard one-bedroom suite with a big bed, TV, little desk, and a small couch. It was nothing special, but it was comfortable.</p>
  <h2>Exploring Sydney</h2>
  <p>After settling in, I headed out to explore Sydney. The weather was beautiful, and the city was putting on a great show. I walked along the harbor and took in the sights, including a large cruise boat docked nearby.</p>
  <p>As I walked, I reflected on my stay in Sydney so far. I had met a few people, including some for a Christmas party that evening. I was also looking forward to meeting more people the next day before heading back to Brisbane.</p>
  <p>As the day drew to a close, I realized that it was time to head back to the airport and prepare for my flight back to Brisbane. It would be time to start the holiday festivities all over again.</p>
