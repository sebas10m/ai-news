	<h1>AI Updates and Trends</h1>
	<p>One of the first stories that garnered attention was the leak of Sora, a powerful AI model, due to an API key being exposed. This sparked a discussion about OpenAI's alpha program and the misuse of public data for research and development.</p>
	<p>Another significant announcement was the release of Anthropic's MCP, a framework that enables Claude to run servers, providing superpowers to the Claude app. This made it possible for Claude to read, create, and edit files and folders locally, which is a game-changer for usability and opens up new areas for users to explore.</p>
	<p>The discussion about AI safety and the potential risks associated with advanced AI systems reignited the debate about open-sourcing big models. Individuals such as Geoffrey Hinton and Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared their concerns about the potential dangers of relying on AI systems that could be exploited for malicious purposes.</p>
	<p>Other notable developments include Sam Altman's prediction of AI arriving in 2035, Geoff Hinton's AGI timeline shifting to 2029, and NVIDIA's Fugato AI breakthrough, which allows for the creation of sounds, speech, and music from text and audio inputs.</p>
	<p>Somers outlined several interesting points, including the possibility of economic growth doubling every month, the potential for AI systems to become indistinguishable from humans, and the connection between AI advancements and economic instability.</p>

	<p>Elon Musk shared his prediction that Optimus, a Tesla bot, will be immensely difficult to get the cost of $20,000, but eventually it will happen and production volume needs to be above 1 million bots per year for that.</p>
	<p>Nvidia's Fugato AI breakthrough allows for the creation of sounds, speech, and music from text and audio inputs, and Luma Labs updated their Dream Machine model to version 1.5, a new model that is really effective.</p>
	<p>Jonathan Ross, a developer at Grok, aims to get Grok to 25 million tokens per second by the end of the year, a feat that is both incredible and uncertain.</p>
	<p>Other notable developments include Sam Altman's prediction of AI arriving in 2035, Geoff Hinton's AGI timeline shifting to 2029, and the potential for AI systems to become indistinguishable from humans.</p>
